2018-11,Showerthoughts,10.0,"This is exactly the point. Vegan food right now is named off of what it's imitating and tries so hard to imitate it that it frequently forgets what it is and totally misses the mark.

Buffalo cauliflower can be delicious. But most I've tried try so hard to *be* buffalo wings despite clearly not being, and wind up tasting the worse for it.

It's not a bad thing to make a food in the style of other foods, but when all your other food is just a really bad imitation with the word vegan tacked on to the beginning it's going to leave a poor taste in the mouth of people who actually know what chili con carn, buffalo wings, hamburgers, etc. taste like.

Honestly it seems like a status thing. Where do you eat vegan buffalo wings? Where everyone else is eating buffalo wings. Where do you eat vegan hamburgers? Where everyone else is eating cheeseburgers. I get it. I get the need for a relative minority to feel inclusivity. But the fact that frequently the method is to just tack the word vegan onto the front of a social food is a big part of the whole ""you'll know they're vegan because they'll tell you 60 times"" stigma comes from.",1,1
2018-01,1200isplenty,3.0,"The first time I ever had buffalo cauliflower it was deep-fried in a cornmeal batter. It was the best ever! I tried to recreate a healthier baked version at home, and it basically tasted like I dredged the cauliflower through tiny bits of gravel. I still haven’t figured out how to get it crispy, so I just toss the cauliflower in buffalo sauce and roast it that way. It’s not the same, but it at least tastes good. ",1,1

2018-08,vegan,6.0,"Keep cooking. You can prove to them it's worth it! Maybe try something like Buffalo cauliflower, vegan twice baked potatoes, jackfruit ""pulled pork"", or a vegan version meatloaf to give them something they can relate to but have a new texture. At the very least, that'll help prepare you with some great options for when you're not living at home. Sometimes adding extra spices helps. If all else fails, eat the sides. Maybe another family member would be happy to take that extra meat off your plate or take your leftovers for a lunch the next day. ",1,1

2018-02,DebateAVegan,5.0,"Well, you can be a purely logical vegan without feeling emotionally attached to animals. 


P1: Except for extreme circumstances, you do not need to consume animals in modern society to survive. (Or even to live a very flourishing happy life for that matter)

P2: farming animals causes them to suffer

C1: You cause unnecessary suffering for convenience and pleasure. 

P3: it is immoral to cause unnecessary suffering to animals.

C2: it is immoral to eat animals and animal products.


I don't feel much in particular towards cows or chickens but I don't  want to harm them unnecessarily when I could just eat some buffalo cauliflower wings or black bean soup or French fries instead. I spend time on my cousins farm or volunteering at an animal sanctuary and it helps me feel a little closer to the animals but logic and reason is still at the core of my belief. Emotion can help keep me there in moments of weakness but it's not even that hard once you reform your habits. People think I live like a monk or something when in reality I'm constantly eating new great food that's usually pretty bad for me.


If you accept those premises and brush off the conclusions with simply ""I don't care"" then there's no argument to be had.",1,1

My OMAD is keto and mostly vegetarian, my husband is not vegetarian. 

Walmart rotisserie chickens -2 
   I got them at 7pm (they were marked down to 3.98) pulled the chicken and dumped them in a pan chopped up with all the juice from the bottom. Added spices to make it like chicken soup, but only a little water. Warmed it through and pulled the chicken out. Made gravy outta what was in the pan (thickened with a little xantham gum from baking aisle). 

Made broccoli salad with....broccoli, chedar cheese shredded, toasted almonds, low sugar dried cranberries, and mayo whipped up with a touch of stevia for sweetness. 

I put the chicken in a low carb pita pocket with cheese...tomato and avocado.

I bought a rutabaga to make into fries in my air fryer. Done it before. They have carbs, but i weigh out the portion. 

I bought a cauliflower to make into buffalo bites.  Called keto  buffalo cauliflower as an online recipe. 

Bought bacon for the hubs, the same rotisserie chicken mix...crumbled bacon cheese, spinach, low carb pita folded like a giant taco. He wont eat raw spinach so i cooked it. (I got thumbs up)

Made peanut butter cookies from a recipe, they were ok, needs tweaking. 

1 c peanut butter, 1 egg, 1/3 cup stevia. Bake at 350 for 12 minutes. 

Bought bai coconut drinks. Kinda pricy, so tasty. 



Bought mushrooms and tofu to fry for breakfast bowls. I fry the mushies till crisp n brown, then crumble the tofu and fry in butter and spices till browned. Then set it aside add it to a bowl, top with scrambled eggs, cheese and salsa....breakfast bowl!


I get plastic containers from the dollar store and make up 300 to 400 cal containers. Then i will eat three of them over two to three hours. Usually I make only enough to make four of each meal as I get bored of the same food longer then that. ",1,1

2018-01,vegan,1.0,"Omg, so many. I'll give you a heads up that instagram is the best place to scope out what YOU would like. I always find that pictures of food helps me decide what I'm in the mood for easier than a menu or reviews or suggestions on reddit. I happen to post tons of vegan eats on my page - @vegan.newyorker.

**Casual Spots:**  

* Cinnamon Snail for burgers/sandwiches is a must  
* Superiority Burger for burgers, sandwiches, and all the sides (it's a vegetarian spot, so be sure to specify that you're vegan. And order the off-menu vegan cheesy collard sandwich)  
* Confectionery! - stop by for vegan chocolates, macarons, and other treats after Superiority Burger, it's just a few doors down.   
* Champs for greasy, vegan diner food. Get the mozzarella sticks.  
* NY Dosa Cart - located on the south side of Washington Square Park, check his instagram to see if he's in the park that day (@nydosas). The best dosa you'll ever have. Get a samosa too. Cash only.  
* Peacefood - decent vegan diner type food. Healthy options, plus plenty of junk food. Get the chickpea fries.  
* Bunna - incredible all vegan Ethiopian restaurant in BK. A few blocks from Pine Box Rock Shop, an all vegan bar. 
* Beyond Sushi - several locations, but the one on 37th is the largest and has table service instead of just counter service. Everything is so fresh and delicious.  
* Ja Ja Ja - Fantastic Mexican food. Great for brunch. The nachos and buffalo cauliflower tacos were standouts.  
* Bodhi  - vegan dim sum. Get the soup dumplings and (there's some controversy around Buddah Bodai/Bodhi Restuarant. Buddah Bodai claims to be the original, but it's my understanding that the original chef was booted out and started Bodhi on Mulberry. Go to the one on Mulberry. It's better.) Vegetarian Dim Sum House is a classic, but I've been disappointed with the food quality on a few occasions. Proceed with caution.  
* Absolute Bagels - classic nyc bagels, they have lots of tofu cream cheese flavors. some bagel flavors have egg wash, so just ask to confirm!  
* Dun-Well Donuts - amazing donuts. Two locations, one in BK and one in the East Village   
* Van Leeuwen - ice cream scoop shops with many vegan flavors.  
* Orchard Grocer - excellent vegan sandwiches and a vegan grocery store. Get the Bowery. And then get all the vegan snacky things and cheese your heart desires. Located next to MooShoes, the vegan shoe store!  
* Riverdel - all vegan cheese shop in Brooklyn. They've got all the good stuff!  


**Dinner/Nicer Spots**  

* Modern Love BK. Seriously wonderful and somewhat elevated vegan comfort food. Also fantastic for brunch.  
* Paulie Gee's - If you want good New York pizza, go here. Maybe make it your first stop. Actually, just go here every night. I adore Paulie Gee's and it's the best . (Although, there's one in Columbus, so you have one close-ish to home too!)  
* Nix - gorgeous upscale restaurant. I've only had wine and appetizers here, but I can't wait to go back. Everything I tried was phenomenal.  
* Double Zero - excellent vegan pizza (not nearly as good as Paulie Gee's, but nothing is)  
* Candle 79/Candle Cafe West - similar menu at both locations. I worked at Candle 79 for a while and everything is delicious. Get the Seitan Piccata if you go to Candle Cafe West. Another great spot for brunch.  


This seems crazy long, but I assure you, I'm just getting started! haha. Feel free to hit me up here or on instagram for more suggestions or if you have any questions!

The cauliflower example is a good one to illustrate how we will likely have to agree to disagree. I love cauliflower, and Fried cauliflower is indeed delicious. But a dish of vegan buffalo cauliflower side by side with a dish of traditional buffalo wings, including a sauce made with equal parts hot sauce and butter and a bleu cheese dressing made with a nice quality bleu, would not be the same, nor fill the same craving.

Buffalo Cauliflower made using the amazing [Mary’s Test Kitchen’s recipe here](http://www.marystestkitchen.com/vegan-buffalo-wings-cauliflower/) (I went for the deep-fried version – don’t judge me).

Tortillas made following [this Breddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/9mpurw/any_love_for_homemade_tortillas/e7hcybg/) (animal fat obviously substituted for vegetable oil; it works great). I made 8 instead of 6 so they were slightly smaller and more taco-sized.

“Ranch” dressing made using silken tofu, aquafaba, lemon juice, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and mint blended together. Not sure about the quantities, I was winging it a bit.

Fixings; avocado, lettuce, fresh coriander, spring onion, jalapenos, cashews, and limes.

Beer; Brewdog Punk IPA because I’m that basic.

Indy is FANTASTIC for vegan food, at least as long as you stick to the local restaurants.

1) Broad Ripple Brewpub, especially if you like traditional English ales - they brew their own beer and it’s only available there. Their vegan fish &amp; chips is greasy, fabulous hangover food. I’d also recommend the Seitan Reuben - they’ll upcharge a dollar if you ask for vegan cheese FYI. The sauce on it is already vegan. Violets vegan burger is also fab, and already has vegan cheese on it. 

2) Three Carrots in Fountain Square is all vegan. They’re also the seitan hub of the city: if you’re eating seitan at a different local restaurant (including BRBP above), they probably bought it from Three Carrots. Hard to make recommendations because everything is so damn good. They’re open for dinner and lunch, or do brunch Sat &amp; Sun 10-2 and the Tofu Benedict Arnold and Loaded B&amp;G are particularly good. Three Carrots also has a more affordable food stand in the City Market downtown, but you’d have to pay for parking. Fountain Square parking is free.

3) Hotel Tango has aquafaba as a substitute for egg whites in their cocktails. They don’t have food, but maybe stop by after Three Carrots (it’s a reasonable walk) because it’s pretty neat to have a proper “egg white” cocktail as a vegan! 

4) Sinking Ship is a mash-up of several subcultures in one bar. Check it out. 21+ only. I’d recommend Seitan Wings with buffalo sauce, sack of balls (doughnuts), and fried pickles.

5) Twenty Tap - get the buffalo cauliflower and a side of fries. Thy have more vegan food than that, but it’s what I get every time. Great beer selection, too. 

6) Pho 54 on Michigan has vegan pho and a number of other vegan Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.

7) General American Doughnut Company has vegan doughnuts but they often run out. Call before you go so you’re not disappointed. 

8) If you want to try the swanky brunch place everyone’s talking about, Milktooth, get the porridge. It’s unclear what else is vegan. You could ask but that’s what I’ve heard through the vegan grapevine and I got the porridge and it was excellent. I FB messaged them before I visited to find out what else is vegan on their menu since it’s unclear and I prefer not to bug the servers / draw attention to myself, but they didn’t get back to me so I just got the porridge. The place is pricey, so be prepared, but they certainly deliver on quality and experience. 

Other honorable mentions: vegan omelette at Patachou (though for as ubiquitous and successful the Patachou regime has become, I’m astounded they haven’t learned how to season tofu! They dice it raw for whatever dishes they use it in. It’s kind of absurd. The garbanzo flour crepe for the omelette is hella good, though), vegan B&amp;G at Sobro Cafe (I stopped going a while ago because they always ran out of either the vegan biscuits or the gravy and it became too disappointing; they do have tofu scramble, though), Vegan burger at Burger Fuel (New Zealand chain; Indy got the first US location), The Garden Table, Kuma’s Corner, La Margarita, Monon Coffee Co (coffee shop, but they always have vegan goodies, a lot prepared by Three Carrots), Tinker Street if you wanna get fancy ($$$), The Flying Cupcake (go to the location in Illinois St; they’ll have the largest vegan selection), Duos Indy (excellent food but hard to get there due to restrictive hours). 

I know I’m forgetting some, but this list should get you started :)

Ingredients

1 head cauliflower, cut into florets

1 cup flour

1 cup water

1 packet powdered ranch mix

Hot sauce

~2 cups panko bread crumbs
(Panko works the best...I've tried using regular bread crumbs, but found the breading didnt stay crisp like it came out of a fryer)

~1 tbsp butter, melted



Directions


1.) Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine flour, water, hot sauce to taste, and ~ 1 tbsp ranch powder into a gallon plastic bag. Combine panko bread crumbs and rest of ranch powder in a separate gallon plastic bag.

2.) Toss cauliflower florets in flour/water batter until coated, then transfer to panko bread crumb bag and toss until coated.

3.) Spread cauliflower pieces out onto a lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.

4.) Combine ~2/3 cup hot sauce and butter (make more sauce if you like them really saucy). Brush mixture on top of cauliflower and return to oven for an additional 10 minutes. Serve with traditional buffalo wing garb. ",1,1

Usually though it's a couple veggie rolls from the local Japanese restaurant (half price rolls!  hold the eel sauce...), a ""fake meat"" sandwich or wrap or hotdog, one of the dozen or so veganizable options at Taco Bell, V foods at Dos Bros, etc etc.

Dinners have become so much more interesting since I went vegan.  My SO isn't vegan, but she is supportive and has altered our family dinners to be items we can all enjoy.  Pastas, stir-fry, wraps, soups, muther-truckin buffalo cauliflower (!!), pizza, etc etc.  And if you like beer, you've got a world of options to choose from.

I've been eating vegan for 2 months.  Aside from one mistake (forgot to hold the eel sauce!) I haven't found it too difficult to adhere to.  The hardest part for me (and my SO) has been when we go out to eat.  There aren't many vegan options at restaurants where I live.  

Anyway, I hope this helps.  GL!",1,1

2018-06,vegan,2.0,"Some things I do (as a person who loves pasta and other starches and eats a similar # of calories to lose weight):

1. Use the higher protein eqivalents. Ex brown rice instead of white, whole wheat bread with a bunch of nuts instead of white bread, whole wheat or other alternative pasta like quinoa or lentil pasta instead of semolina. This alone should help a lot.
2. Nut based sauces on pastas. A good cashew cream sauce over a lentil pasta = super high protein meal. 
3. Eat more tofu, tempeh, lentils and beans. 
4. Consider adding a protein smoothie. I use orgain vanilla protein, blend it with a frozen banana and some almond milk, maybe a handful of spinach, and it is a quick and delicious way to get over 20g of protein. 

I can easily get 70g of protein in a day (my target). Just make sure you incorporate some high protein food in every meal.

And because it might help here's what I ate yesterday: breakfast was overnight oats with chia seeds, hemp seeds, almond granola and blueberries. Lunch was leftover lasagna featuring brown rice pasta and tofu ricotta. For a snack I had a banana-strawberry protein shake and a couple apricots. Dinner was a huge pile of buffalo cauliflower with some carrot sticks and peanut dipping sauce. Came in at about 1500 calories and 74g protein. ",1,1

2018-02,food,3.0,"Here is what I used:

Buttermilk Buffalo Cauliflower Bites:
1 head of Cauliflower broken up into pieces
2 eggs
2 tablespoons Buttermilk (or Water)
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons red cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon cracked pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
vegetable oil for frying (at least 3 inches of oil in a frying pan/pot)

Buffalo Hot Sauce:
1/4 cup salted butter, melted
1 tablespoon red cayenne pepper
1/2 cup Frank's Red Hot
1 tablespoon Sriracha
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon cracked pepper

Buttermilk Blue Cheese Sauce:
4oz Buttermilk Blue Cheese Pieces (Reg Blue Cheese is fine)
8oz sour cream
1/3 cup Buttermilk 
2 Tbsp Chopped Fresh Chives
1 Tsp Lemon Zest
1 Tbsp Lemon Juice
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cracked black pepper

Topping:
green onion
shredded celery

Directions:
Heat the oil in deep-fryer or deep-fry safe pot/pan to medium (about 325 degrees). Line a cooling rack with a few layers of paper towels and set nearby the fryer. 

In a medium bowl, scramble the eggs with 2 tbsp buttermilk. In a second bowl or large Ziplock bag, combine all of the dry ingredients for the cauliflower bites. 

Take the pieces of cauliflower, toss them in the flour mixture to coat them. Dip the pieces in the egg wash, toss it around to coat thoroughly and return to flour dredge. Coat well.

Working in batches, being sure not to crowd the pan, fry the cauliflower pieces until they are golden brown. Remove from the pan and lay on the paper towels. Let the pieces rest for one minute, then return them to the pan for an additional 1-2 minutes. This second run in the fryer gives it an extra crispy finish! 
While the cauliflower is frying, make the sauce by combining all ingredients in a large bowl. Place the warm pieces of fried cauliflower in the bowl, toss to coat them evenly in the sauce. Serve immediately and garnish with Blue cheese, celery shreds and green onion.",1,1

This is exactly what I do on most of my trips.  I've only been to a museum in NYC once {and that didn't go so well for so many reasons}, mostly I just wander around a neighborhood or two.  The one thing I want to know something about is where the good food is.  Winging that part of my trips hasn't always worked out so I prepare a bunch of locations and have ideas for whatever place I wind up.  If I'm going with, or meeting, other people I have a bunch of recommendations and it helps with the indecision.  I tortured people I was in Chicago with whenever they started the endless ""what do you want to eat"" conversation by reminding them I had sent them all a map.  We didn't always choose from that, but mostly we did and it worked out well.  :)

I had written down the buffalo cauliflower and salad looked good at Fresh, but it seems the Spadina location is closed.  Burro Burrito or Kupfert and Kim are right there and they look interesting as well.  A burrito bowl with chips sounds perfect. 

Woodlot sounds really nice.  I probably won't go to a nice place like that on my own, but I put it on the map in case I go back with other people.  It seems like a good place to have a nice long dinner.

2018-10,AskNYC,2.0,"Great!  This explains a lot...

Look at your high ticket items: 

$10 for Koolaid?!

Over $35 for meat?

Lactaid $6 because you can't have dairy, then $18 on dairy?  (Including pizza)

Then another $13 on junk food.  

The ONLY produce you have is bananas and romaine.  This should be your starting point.

I know you are asking about budget, but a small diet talk: this is no bueno.  You think food is expensive?  Wait until your health declines.  

These are not groceries, you can buy most of this at a 7-11, that isn't a good sign.

Okay, for price and health the bulk of your budget should be vegetable based: potatoes/sweet potatoes, quinoa/brown rice/corn tortillas eggplant, squash, cauli, broccoli, spinach, kale.   Then add in some healthier and cheaper protein: beans: black or refried for Mexican.  White for italian.  Chick peas for Indian or Mediterranean. Tofu for asian.  You can *garnish* with meat and cheese sometimes if you like.  Nuts are a good sub.

Ideas:  

Veggie chili.  Beans, canned tomatoes, corn etc.  There are tons of good recipes.  I found this amazing recipe for a refried bean soup, you literally just open 5 cans and you are done.

Asian stirfry: broccoli, bean or tofu, sauce from soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic and ginger powder, sriracha, serve over rice

Enchiladas: filling can be black beans, squash, kale, roll up tortillas, cover in homemade enchilada sauce (chili powder and veggie broth mainly).  

Tacos: same fillings or my fave with buffalo cauliflower.  Or I go lazy and do tortilla, beans, hot sauce and avocado.

Cook escarole with white beans, chili flakes, lemon, garlic.  Serve with whole wheat pasta.  

Roast chopped veggies, mix with tahini with lemon and garlic and water.  

They have a fun falafel mix at TJs, just bake them instead.

In the fall winter I shove a bunch of stuff into the oven together to roast: acorn squash, onion, garlic, chopped cauli, eggplant, chickpeas and then use it throughout the week  Throw the squash in a blender with garlic and onion and some broth and have an amazing soup.  Add some white beans and spinach and even better.

I chop romaine and mix with sundries tomatoes, chick peas, artichoke hearts (packed in water) and nuts and make an amazing salad.

For bread I buy whole wheat pita or even better sprouted Ezekiel.

For a sweet snack get apples with peanut butter.

For a salty snack get an air popper and pop popcorn.  Top with flax oil a bit of salt and nutritional yeast (like cheesy flavor).

Add avocado to any of the above.  

These are just starter ideas.  I don't know what your tastes are!

Mac and cheese made with some pureed butternut squash is fabulous (still has milk/greek yogurt and cheese, but significantly less cheese and no heavy cream). Serve your pasta sauce over roasted spaghetti squash. You can also add just about any vegetable to a quiche, scramble or strata. If she likes tomato, a ratatouille is a great starting point since it's really just eggplant, zucchini and yellow squash in amazing tomato sauce.

If fried food is your thing, you can do oven fried vegetables. Cauliflower is versatile and I love buffalo cauliflower florets. My favorite way to do cauliflower is slater the entire thing in a mix of yogurt and curry powder and carve it up like a roast, but that might be a bit too much to start with.

CAbbage is another great option that you can add to stir fry or cook down with plenty of seasoning. If she's a fan of sour flavors, a german cooked cabbage is great (and the easiest thing in the world with just salt, apple cider vinegar, apples, onion and caraway)

Is she a fan of fruit? You can also start to introduce some vegetables in a way that makes fruit the focus. Beet, orange and goat cheese salad with mint is a classic. I assume salads in general are probably out, but what about salads that are hefty (and honestly, not very healthy). I'm referring to cobb salad and the like.

2018-03,loseit,2.0,"You could try a few discipline strategies as well (mindfulness habits???).

1) Tell yourself that if you want the snack, that you have to drink a full serving of water and wait twenty minutes, then re-evaluate.  That should help if you’re just experiencing a passing fancy or are actually thirsty.  This helps especially in conjunction with not being bored.  Are there things that you should be doing, or a little hobby that you can pick up?  I try to do a chore as soon as I get home because they need doing, and I can avoid the afternoon snack if I’m busy, and then it’s time for dinner.  

2) Have something like plain snap peas, carrots, or broccoli on hand.  Something with a low calorie count, and palatable, but not necessarily crave-worthy.  When you feel hungry for a snack, say ok, I can measure out a serving of a veggie and go for it!  If that doesn’t seem appealing, then you can tell yourself that you aren’t really hungry and that you are seeking a treat, not a snack.   That helps me let it go.

3) Have a plan for substitutes.  If I want a sweet treat, but don’t have the calorie budget, I make a cup of herbal tea, no milk, no sugar.  Some of them are fairly sweet.  If I want a savory treat, I have a cup of heated low-sodium broth (there are varying calorie counts here).  Most of the time that that gets it.

4) Really address the craving!  Put a mental marker on it.  Figure out what it is you want - is it a very specific item, a flavor or texture, or just a general desire to indulge?  If it’s a flavor or texture, can you work in a CICO friendly sub (I.e. sliced peppers for crunch, Buffalo cauliflower for savory, fruit for sweet)?  If it’s a specific item, can you plan it into your day? If it’s a desire to indulge yourself, will a non-food activity do? 

If it’s a difficult item to fit, you might just let it go and see if you’re still craving it in a day or two.  That’s how I know that I have a real craving and not just a passing fancy.  I personally would rather have the exact thing that I’m craving then try to substitute a bunch of stuff and still spend the calories on that thing anyway.  In some cases, I have made a constant craving part of my week and just accounted for it.  I usually get a cookie from the café once a week, which is way more sustainable than getting one every day.  I know that it’s there and that I have one coming, so I can put a pin in my craving for now.  ",1,1

2018-05,Louisville,3.0,"Have you tried cauliflower mash?   I steam about two heads of cauliflower, strain it really well, add a tablespoon of Kerrygold salted butter, pepper, garlic salt, a little bit of bacon grease, a splash of heavy cream, and about 2 cups of shredded cheese, whatever flavor works.  Mix it really well so that it has the consistency of thick mashed potatoes.   He loves this shit and asks for it weekly!   

Baked broccoli is another one of his favorites.  He doesn’t like it raw and is meh about it steamed but baked in the oven, he loves. Head of broccoli, cut into bit size pieces, roll in a little olive oil, add seasonings, bake on 375 until edges start to brown and it gets crispy.  It changes the flavor, a lot!   

Also, bacon wrapped asparagus was another one he fancies now.   Buffalo cauliflower bites were a hit as well.

2018-04,proED,14.0,"I got u. I don't have any ideas with meat or dairy though because I'm vegan.

* Shirataki noodles - you've probably heard of these or tried them or who knows, but they're a staple for me tbh. If you need help cooking them lmk, but basically 12 cals max in an entire package and it looks like a feast when mixed with veggies or cheese. Can easily be tailored to fit a normal meal: want italian? add tomato paste and marinara sauce with thyme and have a side salad. want lo mein? add bean sprouts, carrots, snap peas and soy sauce mixed with pb2 for a topping. There's also shirataki rice which is great for ""burritos,"" mexican rice, sushi, stuffed bell peppers, and just the rice version of the lo mein I said. 
* Low cal bread is also a staple, particularly in this situation. There are tortillas that are only 50 cals a piece (my brand is xtreme wellness). There's also a nature's own bread that's 40 cals per slice - you could easily make a pb2 n j with 2 slices that's under 150 cals. Not a protein food obviously but you could easily make a side salad w beans or have the beans as a side or go a step further and make it a burger on that bread w baked beans on the side. You could also slice a potato and stick it in the oven and have ""chips.""
* Tortilla mini pizza. I use the aforementioned 50 cal tortillas and top with tomato paste or even marinara sauce and various veggies and stick it in the oven for 10 minutes or so. It's super good, almost always under 150 cals total, and can be dressed up with real cheese if you so please or you can make 2 for 300 cals total and a 100 cal side salad.
* Veggie bowls. Idk how they're different from salad really lol but they're great. I either use lettuce or shirataki rice as the base and then add (without mixing it, I guess *that's* the difference) a bunch of veggies on top in an aesthetically pleasing manner lmao. An example of one I made: shirataki rice base mixed w onion and seasoned w soy sauce topped w avocado slices, cherry tomatoes, cucumber noodles (spiralized cucumber), sprouts, green beans, pepperoncini, n falafel balls (chickpeas, garlic, oats, spinach, pb2) I handmade w a pb2 soy sauce topping. The total for that was 357 and it was huge and super filling.
* Lettuce tacos. Also a staple. Or even lettuce chicken/tuna salad boats (for me that means homemade vegan mayo and tofu lol). I really like this one bc you can have like 15 and it's still not over 400 cals - depending on how much filling you put in of course. Buffalo cauliflower is also a good idea for this. There are tons of recipes out there that can be tailored to be low cal and it's really, really good - and that's coming from someone who hated cauliflower until a month ago. (oh and I second whoever recommended cauliflower rice, even better than shirataki rice)

Now, a list of just some ideas without explanation you can look into if you're interested:


* Potato nachos
* Potato cakes
* Smashed avocado chickpea sandwiches
* Portabella mushroom ""pizzas""
* Chickpea ""fried chicken""
* Sushi
* Rice wrapper spring veggie rolls
* Lentil ""meat"" loaf
* ""Creamy"" avocado shirataki or cucumber noodles
* Lentil sloppy joes
* Kale, black bean, avocado, tomato, buffalo cauliflower/lentils/etc. bowl
* Pesto spinach shirataki rice stuffed bell peppers

Honestly, 90% of finding good, satisfying meals that are also very convincing is researching recipes extensively and then tailoring them to your caloric needs. It's a lot of work, but I really enjoy doing it - or rather I hate eating the same thing over and over again lol - so I've made a lot of great ones. My honest advice is eating more vegan (or like no dairy meat inclusive) meals when you're with him because I've found I can eat way more as a vegan on 500 calories a day than I ever could've as a meat &amp; dairy eater.

I think the point of what the starter pack was getting at is not that the meat doesn't add anything, but that frequently the seasoning is a predominant part of the dish.

2018-02,EatCheapAndHealthy,229.0,"If you  want easy and cheap, Buffalo Cauliflower is a good way to go. At its most basic level, you toss Cauliflower chunks in oil and some salt, bake at 425 F for about 20 minutes, and then toss in Buffalo sauce.  If you want to up the flavor, toss the cauliflower in a mix of 1/2 C flour and 1/2 C water or milk and the spices of your choice before baking. 

If you want to go even crazier, you can do a Panko or smashed up corn flake breading. I’ve never tried that out, but the internet says it’s possible.

2018-09,loseit,6.0,"My husband and I don't eat ""diet food,"" but I maintain around 127 lbs at 5'6"" while he's 190ish at 5'11"". We eat plant-based, but we eat a LOT of different types of cuisines (including a lot of pizza, oddly enough). Our favorite thing to get while out is probably Thai food, but curry (more Indian-style than Thai at home) is one of the main things we make at home. We grew up in very white conservative American homes where you had your protein, your starch, and your vegetable, and prior to dating one another, he'd never really had fruit outside of bananas or apples. We try all kinds of things and are always looking up new recipes.

1) Get comfortable with a few spices or seasonings and find a few things he likes. We're making [buffalo cauliflower](https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/recipes/2014/2/11/cauliflower-buffalo-wings) tonight as a side, and I am pumped. It doesn't taste like a diet food, but it's legit healthy (we omit the butter from the buffalo sauce mixture, because you don't need it, and use gluten free flour because it makes it crispier in our experience, but oat flour and whole wheat flour also work well, as do chickpea and almond flour, with that extra protein kick)

2) Roast your vegetables. They taste a lot better. Literally everything tastes better roasted.

3) Cut out oil in sauteeing. You really don't need it. Use broth instead to deglaze the pan when necessary. This cuts out a lot of unnecessary calories (&gt;100 per tablespoon, and we noticed it adding up for us). 

4) Maybe try intermittent fasting. Basically, I plan out what I'm eating roughly for the day, then start eating at 11 or noon and stop around 8 or 9 pm. I keep it within my calorie range, making sure I'm eating enough, but then I have more of an immediate look at what I'm eating, so I know if I'm eating junk.

&gt;
&gt;But when I smell the scent coming from the vents of a steakhouse or when I see a picture of chicken wings I start to salivate. 
&gt;
&gt;What is this? Conditioning? I made some buffalo cauliflower bites and they satisfied that craving, so I’m thinking it might be just old habits or something. Why do humans crave it if it’s not good for them?

They also season and prepare the food, it isn't just that its meat. Could be conditioning but could also be something ingrained. In any case, humans crave all sorts or stuff that's no good for them. Pure sugar, alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, etc. Sure, some might be conditioning but all? That's a dubious claim I think.",1,1

He would. Because it sounds like you are not working with him or getting through to him, you're controlling all of his food. And hey, it is extremely important that he lose weight. But in order to maintain it he must learn *self* discipline, not just discipline. 

&gt; I don’t see people allowing themselves cheat days.

Uhhhhh ahaha lol do you even read this sub? Look, there are absolutely people who are extremely restrictive and disciplined with themselves. And that works for them! It's their choice. It's also true that this sub generally discourages cheat days - because CICO. DIeting all week and then eating like you are not on a diet can completely negate the calories you ""saved"" during the week. There is also often a psychological component where it can contribute to backsliding, or making dieting feel like a punishment - you shouldn't be living for ""cheats"". It's generally more encouraged to go for ""cheat"" meals where calories have been further reduced during the week to allow a larger/richer meal to not make an impact on calories reduced.

What I see most is people talking about how they learn to incorporate their wants into their dietary needs on a daily basis. If he wants chicken wings, he should learn how to incorporate them into calories counting. You don't go into his diet but since he is a teenager who probably wants fast/unhealthy food, I would tell you to consider how to cook faux fast. I.e. baked macaroni with cauliflower and cottage cheese, baked buffalo wings, buffalo cauliflower, jackfruit tacos or enchiladas, yogurt subbed for sour cream, baked fries, burger with a lettuce wrap, homemade sauces with decreased fat and increased acid and salt, decreasing unnecessary sugar, etc. Showing him how he can eat things that he enjoys but alter them to be calorie conscious. 

It isn't abusive to not allow him to eat wings, but the ways in which food is allowed or denied can be an issue, and there should be a way to incorporate some not-so-good-stuff into the good stuff. Your efforts to help him may backfire if you contribute to further complexes about fun, happy food vs. sad diet food. Help him figure out how to make choices he's happy about regularly, and cut some calories during the week + eat smaller meals day of eating out so that when you go to a restaurant he can choose what he likes.

**What can you do with tofu?**

Most times when I cook tofu I start the same way.  It seems like a lot of work but it's worth it to me. You wanna get it firm, especially if you are new to tofu.  Buy extra-firm or firm.  The water-packed kind, not the one that comes in a tetrapack.

  1.  I start out by slicing it [pretty much like this](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/tofu-slices-17160975.jpg)
  2.  Put the pieces between two layers of paper towels and lightly press out some of the water.
  3.  Sprinkle with coarsely grounded salt and pepper on both sides.
  4.  Cook for 10-12 minutes on each side on an oiled non- stick pan over medium high heat, pressing every minute or two.
  5.  *Optional:  You can marinate it after it cools.  (Soy sauce or pickle juice make good bases)*

  * Cut each piece into 4-6 triangles and throw in a stir-fry or salad. 
  * Cut them long ways, coat with flour, deep-fry and then roll in a mix of Franks red-hot and earth balance to make buffalo style tofu.
  * Chop them into small pieces and then add taco seasoning, a little water and finish off in a skillet for a taco/burrito filling.
  * Brush them with barbecue sauce and bake in an oven. Turn over halfway through the cooking. Eat 'em like ribs.
  * Marinate one piece in tumeric(for color), black salt(aka Kala Namak.  It smells like eggs) and liquid mix.  Dice it and add to your fried rice for egg bits or eat it on a sandwich.


**General recipes/ideas**

* Burrito Bowl - Just like Chipotle, start with rice then black beans, (optional xtra protein like taco seasoned tofu, beef-style crumbles or fake chicken)grilled peppers and onions, corn, lettuce, pico de gallo and guac. 
* Stir Fry - Carrots, celery, bell peppers, broccoli, mushrooms and cabbage with the prepared tofu(add some cashews too).  Sauce: soy, rice vinegar, sugar, sesame oil.  Make fried rice, add a half cup of frozen peas and carrots.                                                                
* Flatbread Pizza.  - If you've found a brand of vegan cheese you like or tolerate; (cheeseless is fine). Just sauce and veggies(mushrooms, black olives, bell peppers, onions, spinach), ground crumbles and vegan cheese on a flat bread baked for a few minutes.
* Curry -  Learning to love and make curry is a must.  My favorites are chickpea potato coconut curry; red lentil dal; and tomato-based kidney bean curry(rajma masala).  Serve with rice.
* Chili - Also learn to make chili. Canned tomatoes, spices or chili mix, black or kidney beans, then a little frozen corn and beef-style crumbles at the end.  Make a big pot, eat it for a few days.  Saltine or Club crackers on the side.
* Shepherd's pie - You can used beef-style crumbles, but cooked lentils work great. Onion, celery sauteed in oil add frozen peas and carrots, lentils, veggie broth, soy sauce, flour, salt, pepper, thyme and paprika. Put in a casserole dish with herbed mashed potatoes on top and bake for an hour.
* Roasted vegetables - I use those as a side when I eat beans and rice, or as an add-in in other recipes. Chop carrots, sweet potatoes, an onion, cauliflower, zuchinni. Olive oil and salt. Finish with black pepper.  Try different roots and veggies.
* Tofu scramble  - Start with diced onion and pepper sauteing in the oil.  Add crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, tumeric, salt, cumin, garlic powder and earth balance.  Wilt some spinach in at the end.  Finish with black pepper and black salt.
* Pasta - I like to make sauce from scratch; but even if you open a jar, add some roasted mushrooms, zucchini and carrots, or vegan sausage or beef-style crumbles.
* Potatoes - Cut into wedges, parboil then toss in olive oil and roast them.    Make mashed potatoes with mushroom or poultry style gravy. Make baked potatoes in the microwave, top with earth balance salt, pepper and chives. Or cut into fries and deep-fry.
* Chickpea mock-tuna salad - Chickpeas,(you don't need a food processor, you can get the right texture with a fork) diced celery, red onion, vegan mayo, lemon juice, salt, pepper (kelp flakes if you got 'em). Put it on a low-carb wrap with lettuce and tomato.
* Tofu ""egg"" salad - Raw tofu mashed a bit, mayo, mustard, scallions, garlic powder, tumeric, black pepper and salt(or black salt).  Spread on toasted wheat bread with a pickle on the side.
* Buffalo cauliflower - Cut the florets down.  Dip in batter, roll in panko seasoned with cayenne pepper, garlic powder salt and pepper. Deep fry or bake then roll the pieces in an earth balance and hot sauce mix.
* Falafel - Have you got into this yet? It's great. The dry mix is fine. Stuff in a pita with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, pickles and olives. You can make it into salad if you prefer.
* Soups - Make your own soups. Cheaper and healthier.  I like brown lentil soup, black bean soup, tortilla soup and pasta e fagioli.  The beans can be canned but he lentils should be dry(they cook quickly).                                                                            
* Freezer burritos - I' make 8-10 on a Saturday when I have time. I have 5 varieties I rotate.
   1.  White rice, black beans, grilled peppers and taco seasoned beef-style crumbles or tofu
   2.  Quinoa, pinto beans, sauteed mushrooms and corn
   3.  Brown rice, black beans roasted mushrooms and sweet potatoes 
   4.  Seasoned rice and coconut chickpea potato and pea curry
   5.  Tofu scramble, sauteed mushrooms, grilled peppers and vegan sausage

- Cauliflower Rice - A new favorite and relatively easy and still low cal. Can eat so much more of it than regular rice!

- Cauliflower Fried Rice - same as above but throw in some meat and frozen veggies for a quick Chinese inspired sub.

- Mashed Cauliflower - save some calories with cauliflower instead of potatoes

- Baked Cauliflower Tots - a cool tater tot substitute. Breadcrumbs add calories though. Didn't work out exactly as I was hoping, but not bad.

City Steam Brewery is fun and they have solid bar food.

Tavern Downtown is your sports option.  They have a shit ton of TVs, pool, etc.  Only thing I eat there is the giant pretzel, which is my go to drunk food.

Ingredients

1 head cauliflower, cut into florets

1 cup flour

1 cup water

1 packet powdered ranch mix

Hot sauce

~2 cups panko bread crumbs (Panko works the best...I've tried using regular bread crumbs, but found the breading didnt stay crisp like it came out of a fryer)

~1 tbsp butter, melted

Directions

1.) Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine flour, water, hot sauce to taste, and ~ 1 tbsp ranch powder into a gallon plastic bag. Combine panko bread crumbs and rest of ranch powder in a separate gallon plastic bag.

2.) Toss cauliflower florets in flour/water batter until coated, then transfer to panko bread crumb bag and toss until coated.

3.) Spread cauliflower pieces out onto a lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.

4.) Combine ~2/3 cup hot sauce and butter (make more sauce if you like them really saucy). Brush mixture on top of cauliflower and return to oven for an additional 10 minutes. Serve with traditional buffalo wing garb.

Broccoli , cauliflower , carrot sticks, celery sticks, grape tomato and sliced cucumbers with hummus dip on the side. Cost me about 10$ to make a big pan full. The only thing you have to do is chop the veggies which doesn't take long. I don't care for the Super Bowl but I do make these for gaming parties! 

Deviled eggs are a nice party / pot luck food. Most people enjoy them. Finger sandwiches with whatever fillings you choose. For something hot, I've made roasted veggie skewers and roasted corn on the cob. Could easily add chicken/beef/pork/sausage/shrimp if meat is in your budget. I've seen bacon wrapped green beans and asparagus at parties before too.

Fruit platter is a good one as well. Pineapple, grapes, apple slices, strawberries, etc... Serve with peanut butter, chocolate or caramel dip.

I like the idea of buffalo cauliflower but I find it a little more difficult to get the cauliflower roasted well. That's just my inexperience with it I suppose.

Hopefully this helps!",1,1

From Bon Appetit:
&gt;Preheat the oven to 425° and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 

&gt;Cut one large cauliflower (about 3 pounds) into medium florets and toss in a bowl with 1 Tbsp. cornstarch, 1 Tbsp. melted coconut oil (for high smoke point and a subtle sweetness, but a neutral oil is also okay), 1 tsp. garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste. 

&gt;Roast for 20 minutes, then stir and roast again until tender—about 10 minutes longer. The cornstarch does wonders for oven-roasted texture, giving it a crispy boost. Do a little taste test for seasoning and texture, toss with ½ cup hot sauce (like Frank's RedHot) in the same bowl, and then roast for about 10 minutes until it's blistered in spots.

I do deviate from the recipe in that I don't use just Frank's RedHot. I mix it with melted butter to make a proper buffalo sauce.",1,1

2018-03,vegan,3.0,"Switching is easier than you'd imagine. It just seems a bit daunting at first to adjust your meal list to veggie/vegan alternatives. Took me around 4 months to learn to cook good veggie food. Then a couple of months after that to ditch cheeses and creams. Though I already bought soy milk for coffees so I was pretty much vegan outside of the occasional pizza or curry with yogurt in.

I'd recommend checking out yummly.com. It's a handy recipe search engine that lets you filter by diets such as vegan/veggie. Easier than using google at least.

My main tip is chickpeas/beans/lentils solve most meal problems. They're a good meat alternative for things you probably already know to cook. Pasta sauces, curries, chillies, etc. 

If you like east asian cuisine that tends to have a lot of battered chicken dishes then consider battered cauliflower. One of my favourite dishes right now is a spicey [orange sauce with battered cauliflower](https://www.yummly.co.uk/#recipe/Orange-Cauliflower-992603).

Not tried it yet, but I suspect the cauliflower trick works pretty well with American-style chicken recipes. Buffalo cauliflower, kentucky cauliflower, etc. Another thing I need to get around to trying is seitan. It's a flour that apparently has a tough but pleasant meat-like texture, great for battering. That and it opens up various [""hail seitan""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWbYI99UMAArcfx.jpg) memes. If you like meatloafs then nutloafs are a pretty interesting alternative.

Finally, there's a lot of vegan/veggie friendly [ready made meals out there these days and straight up meat alternatives](https://myvegansupermarket.co.uk/) (uk site, but a lot of the products are international). Even [Ben &amp; Jerry's have a dairy free range](https://www.benjerry.com/flavors/non-dairy).",1,1

2018-08,Futurology,1.0,"Honestly as long as you’re not using a lot of meat and cheese substitutes, being vegan is very inexpensive.  For milk, there almond, soy, cashew, hemp, rice, and coconut milk that’s all not much more expensive than normal milk.  Fruits, veggies, and grains like rice and quinoa are very inexpensive.  Beans, lentils, and chickpeas are great for protein and feeling full, as well as potatoes for carbs.  Some of my favorite vegan meals to make are buffalo cauliflower, samosas, carrot soup with corn bread, falafel and hummus, veggie burgers, breakfast smoothies, and vegetable stir fry/ pad Thai.  I’d recommend checking out r/vegan and r/veganrecipes for more about cooking.  For baking, I like to use either flax seeds or bananas as a replacement for eggs and coconut oil to replace butter.  I know cheese is often hard for people to give up, so if you’re looking for any cheese substitutes, I’d recommend Follow Your Heart or Chao (these two are a bit expensive though).

From my point of view I'll take TVP in place of ground beef, or (if you're in the states) Trader Joe's sausageless sausage cut up in tomato based pasta sauce, but the rest I'd rather not  eat.

2018-06,vegan,15.0,"&gt; How do you stick your vegan diet in family situations? My SOs family are midwestern folks and I can’t see them going out of their way to accommodate me if I went vegan 

There are many things you can do.  You can eat ahead of time.  If it's a family dinner or a potluck (rather than a restaurant), it may be more comfortable for you to bring your own dish.  You can go and just drink the beverages (which often are more likely to be vegan).  

&gt; my own family are not in any way interested in figuring out how veganism works.

Maybe they won't be, but maybe they will be.  You'd be surprised what people become interested in it and how some people can change.  And at the convincing power of well-made vegan food.  

Here are some filling or comforting recipes that might have more approachable flavors for them:

* [Alfredo sauce](http://ohsheglows.com/2014/01/20/cauli-power-fettuccine-alfredo-vegan/) can be made out of tofu, cauliflower, Navy beans, or many other things

One tip: Don't announce that what you're making is vegan at first, or they might not even try it.  Instead of introducing it as ""Vegan mashed potatoes"", just say you're making ""mashed potatoes"".  

&gt; I’m a freelance writer so sometimes I can have a lot of cash and other times not so much- How do you sustain a vegan lifestyle no matter your income level?

Rice and beans are extremely cheap and versatile (many different cuisines use them: Indian dal and rice, black beans and rice in Mexican burritos, [Moro de Habichuelas](https://www.dominicancooking.com/569-moro-de-habichuelas-rice-and-black-beans.html)).  There are many other fruits and vegetables that are also relatively inexpensive (things like cabbage, carrots, onions, kale, canned tomato sauce, frozen spinach, apples, oranges, bananas, etc., tend to be very cheap in the US).  Cooking meals at home using ingredients that are in-season or on sale can save a lot of money.  Personally I saved money when I went vegan compared to what I spent before I did.  

&gt; I have a lot of research to do about what eating meat does to the environment but have any of you gone vegan for slightly less noble reasons? vanity meaning weight loss?

People start eating plant-based diets for all sorts of reasons.  You don't have to start doing it for exactly the same reasons as anyone else, to have much of the same immediate practical, beneficial impact on the rest of the world anyway (you'd still be doing an enormously good thing, whether you ""wanted to"" or ""cared about it"" or not).  And also, just because you don't initially make a change to your diet for one particular reason (like environmentalism), that doesn't mean you can't come to appreciate it or learn more about it later.  In fact, I think that seems to be the case a lot (anecdotally lots of people seem to report learning more about and embracing different aspects or motivations for veganism the longer they do it).  

If you're looking to go vegan as part of trying to be healthier, you might want to look into eventually working towards a ""whole foods plant based diet"", abbreviated WFPB.  The largest subreddit for it is /r/PlantBasedDiet/.  

Also, no matter how much vegan junk food or vegan healthy food you eat, it's a good idea to learn a bit about vegan nutrition in the beginning.  Here are some guides generously made available by vegan Registered Dietitians: 

* http://www.theveganrd.com/vegan-nutrition-101/food-guide-for-vegans/
* https://veganhealth.org/

&gt; what do you eat for snacks? A lot of my fave snacks has dairy in them. I’ve started eating more fruits as snacks though.

Not healthy, but a surprisingly large [number of chips](https://www.peta2.com/news/vegan-potato-tortilla-chips/) are vegan.  Besides fruit there's also: 

* Veggie sticks and hummus 
* Pretzels 
* sweet Trail mixes or dried fruits and nuts 
* Savory or spicy [roasted nuts or seeds](https://www.kitchenkonfidence.com/2014/01/chile-lime-pepitas)

2018-11,xxfitness,2.0,"Obviously apart from veggies, I eat a load of eggs, Greek yoghurt, and cottage cheese. 
Also, unsure where you live, but these mixes https://theproteinbreadco.com.au have really helped me hit my daily protein goals. They do ship internationally, but are easier to get in Australia. 

My three go to meals while cutting are:
Overnight oats: 30-50g rolled oats, 25-100g almond milk, 140g Greek yoghurt, 12g PB2, 34g chocolate protein powder, 10g Stevia, dash of vanilla. I adjust the oats and almond milk depending on how many calories I want to hit and how thick I want it.

Protein Egg salad: I follow this recipe https://thisunmillenniallife.com/cottage-cheese-egg-salad/ but toss in some celery and eat with two slices of protein bread. They suggest it makes two servings, but sometimes I eat it all haha. 

Then dinner I often have various crustless egg bakes/quiches (your fav veggies might be different than mine so won't do specifics), but I also highly recommend any of the new chickpea/lentil/edamame pasta with veggies. The macros work out so much better and as I still struggle to hit protein goals, anything that is higher protein/lower carbs is something I like trying. I've made this: https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/greek-yogurt-macaroni-and-cheese/ using lentil pasta instead and replacing half the pasta with broccoli. So creamy and yum. 

I also do lots of stuff with Greek yoghurt, it's crazy versatile. Sometimes I strain it overnight to make cream cheese then mix with herbs for a dip with veggies/chips/sandwich spread.

2018-10,unpopularopinion,2.0,"I think you could eat that much if the food was prepared right. Like I make these buffalo cauliflower bites. I’ve gotten compliments from them from meat-eaters and vegetarians alike. I usually eat a whole head of cauliflower in a sitting when it’s prepared like that. 

If I were to eat a whole head of cauliflower just steamed.... I’d be suffering through it from the first bite lol. It’s like eating a steak unseasoned. Just... bleh.

As for broccoli to cod/turkey/chicken, I’d point to spinach as an more equal calorie to protein ratio. My point isn’t that plant protein is better than meat protein. Just that there isn’t a deficiency of protein on a plant based diet, which is widely and incorrectly believed- which is why I pointed out the vegan body builder.

I’m not all about converting people to veganism. I’m a firm believer in living how you want. But I think your side of the debate will always be weak because 99% of people say they can’t do it, when they haven’t actually tried doing it.

8 years ago I would definitely be saying the same thing as you. But as time progressed forward, more and more vegan products (fake meats) are being made.

Trying Gardien meatballs, or tofurky sausages, (I could list down forever but I won’t for TLDR sake), those products really made the vegan lifestyle doable for me- for convince and financially. And I’ll attach a photo of what one- ONE tofurky sausage has as nutritional facts https://i.imgur.com/JGLGvkO.jpg  It blew my mind.

That plus the combination of my positive personal health effects really proved to me that meat, in my diet for my body, was a negative impact.

2018-03,Destiny,5.0,"It's easier than you'd imagine. It just seems a bit daunting at first to adjust your meal list to veggie/vegan alternatives. Took me around 4 months to learn to cook good veggie food. Then a couple of months after that to ditch cheeses and creams. Though I already bought soy milk for coffees so I was pretty much vegan outside of the occasional pizza or curry with yogurt in.

I'd recommend checking out yummly.com. It's a handy recipe search engine that lets you filter by diets such as vegan/veggie. Easier than using google at least.

My main tip is chickpeas/beans/lentils solve most meal problems. They're a good meat alternative for things you probably already know to cook. Pasta sauces, curries, chillies, etc. 

If you like east asian cuisine that tends to have a lot of battered chicken dishes then consider battered cauliflower. One of my favourite dishes right now is a spicey [orange sauce with battered cauliflower](https://www.yummly.co.uk/#recipe/Orange-Cauliflower-992603).

Not tried it yet, but I suspect the cauliflower trick works pretty well with American-style chicken recipes. Buffalo cauliflower, kentucky cauliflower, etc. Another thing I need to get around to trying is seitan. It's a flour that apparently has a tough but pleasant meat-like texture, great for battering. That and it opens up various [""hail seitan""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWbYI99UMAArcfx.jpg) memes. If you like meatloafs then nutloafs are a pretty interesting alternative.

Finally, there's a lot of vegan/veggie friendly [ready made meals out there these days and straight up meat alternatives](https://myvegansupermarket.co.uk/) (uk site, but a lot of the products are international).

**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup quinoa
* 1 - 1 1/2 cup hot sauce (I recommend Franks Buffalo Sauce)
* 1/2 head cauliflower cut into smaller pieces
* 1 tsp olive oil
*1 tsp garlic powder
*  1 cup broccoli florets
* 3/4 cup shredded carrots
* 3/4 cup shredded cabbage
* 1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles plus more for garnish
* 1 avocado, sliced
* 4 green onions chopped

**Directions:**

1. Cook the quinoa as per the package instructions.

2. Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees. Line baking sheet with foil. 

3. Combine cauliflower, olive oil, garlic powder, and 3/4 cup buffalo sauce. Stir well and spread evenly on the baking sheet. Cook for 20 mins, flipping halfway. 

4. Heat a medium size skillet over medium high heat. Add the broccoli and cook 3-5 minutes or until the broccoli is tender. Remove from the heat.

5. In a large salad bowl, toss together the cooked quinoa, roasted cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, shredded cabbage, and as much of the buffalo sauce as desired. Add the blue cheese and half of the green onions. Toss again and serve warm with extra blue cheese crumbles, the remaining green onions, and avocado.

 A few years ago on a health kick I heard it could be subbed for mashed potatoes, but when I tried it I ended up with a watery, gross mess that kind of smelled bad. I still don't know quite what I did wrong, but it turned me off trying any of the cauliflower rice or other recipes that have been showing up on my social media.

But then I tried deep fried cauliflower and it was really good! But not healthy, so I sort of forgot about it. Then one evening at a restaurant my dad wanted to split an order of buttermilk fried cauliflower - which it turned out was drenched in buffalo sauce and drizzled with blue cheese dressing - heaven! That inspired me to try a Sheppards pie topped with cauliflower and it was good too. All of which got me wondering what other vegetables I might like if I gave them a fair shot?

2018-10,vegan,2.0,"&gt; Since I'm a chef, while at work is the hardest part, because I inadvertently taste foods all day long.

There are ways besides tasting to tell when foods are done or when you've added enough of an ingredient, although it may be harder to do at first if you aren't used to it.  Instead of determining it by taste, you pay closer attention to the way they 

* look
* smell
* sound, or 
* feel 

(in some cases you have to do this anyway, because you can't cut into them to taste them without ruining their appearance.  Like in, for example, many baked goods).  

&gt; Gluten free is more of a challenge since I love bread.

I don't have much experience with this, but there at least exist some recipes you can try; 

* https://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;q=gluten+free+vegan+bread+recipe

A comment on some gluten-free vegan food: 

* https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/9r5kqb/looking_for_some_compassionate_advice/e8er3q8/

&gt; I also really love cheese.

Unfortunately, I think that vegan cheeses are some of the least successful vegan substitutes right now.  You have to keep in mind that you're not always going to find an exact replica of absolutely everything (because these things are not made from the same stuff), but your tastes can also change over time.  So instead of trying to find an exact replacement, I'd try and focus on exploring other kinds of vegan food or cuisine for at least a couple weeks, and if you are set on wanting to use vegan cheeses, try to appreciate them for what they are on their own, as flavorful foods, even if they aren't exact copies of foods you are familiar with.  

I think two of the best commercial vegan cheeses are Chao Creamy Original (tastes like a very mild provolone or buttercase), and Go Veggie Parmesan Style Topping (be sure to check the ingredients of Go Veggie products if you get them, as that brand also sells vegetarian foods) for a grated Parmesan imitation.  

There are also many homemade recipes for cheese.  Cheese sauces that don't try to imitate solid unmelted cheese, or the stretchiness of melted cheese (both of which are difficult to mimic textures) are easier, often cheaper to make, and tasty, but again, they're not exact replicas.  If you want to try them, I'd make them with or on another dish that has other components, rather than alone, so they aren't the ""only thing"" you're focusing on.  For example: 

* Hot for Food's [nacho cheese sauce](https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/recipes/2015/1/22/nacho-cheese), on [loaded vegan nachos](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan+nachos&amp;num=100&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X) (rather than just as a dip alone with chips).  
* Vegan Alfredo imitations made from cashews, cauliflower, or tofu, on pasta dishes with leafy greens or peas and mushrooms (rather than just pasta).  (Gluten free pasta made from corn or lentils exists). 
* Dips, spreads, dressings, or sauces like: https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/vegan-blue-cheese-dip/, https://www.theedgyveg.com/2016/01/20/best-caesar-dressing-vegan/ on Buffalo cauliflower wings or complete salads (rather than just celery or carrot sticks and lettuce).  
* For a soft mozarella-like topping on a margherita style pizza, try [this one](https://vedgedout.com/2013/03/11/individual-vegan-margherita-pizzas-with-homemade-fresh-moxarella-cheese/).

Finally, if you're really curious, you can make aged vegan cheese, which often starts with a base of nuts (or other fatty ingredients).   

For someone with your cooking background, they aren't going to be too difficult to make, but they do take a long time (because you have to age them), and sometimes have expensive ingredients.  

One of the strongest and closest tasting cheeses you can make is actually for blue cheese, because much of the taste in it doesn't come from the dairy ingredients, it will come from the blue fungus Penicillium roqueforti in both dairy and non-dairy versions.

It is my version of meat and potatoes.  

1. Roast portabello mushroom caps with soy sauce, balsamic, garlic, etc.  This is your ""steak""

2. Steam the hell out of some cauliflower and blend with garlic, and bullion, or just S&amp;P.   These are your mashed potatoes.  

3. Sautee some kale (or greens of choice) with garlic... you get the picture.

You end up with this massive, hearty plate, with extra ""gravy"" from the mushrooms to go over the potatoes.  

Another fave is I make mac and cheese from blended cauliflower as the base over whole wheat noodles.    I steam and blend cauli, and use that instead of water/soymilk/most of cornstarch in this recipe:

https://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2007/10/easy-macaroni-and-cheeze.html

It also just makes an amazing cheese sauce you can pour over veggies.  Or stir in salsa for nachos over oven baked tortilla chips. 

You can also grill cauliflower steaks and serve them over sauteed spinach and chick peas.  (quinoa optional)

Or buffalo cauliflower tacos are great.

I've got a gravy bowtie recipe that I've never written out before/make on the fly. It's pretty simple though, just make your favourite gravy (or do one from scratch) and boil the noodles on the side, then mix.

&amp;#x200B;

Dice an onion and slice a mushroom and fry them up then put aside. Mix equal parts flour and butter (half cup each) in a sauce pan and stir. Once thickened/combined, add two cups of vegetable stock and stir. Keep 2 more cups on standby. Continue stirring until it begins to thicken up, then add mushrooms/onions. Be sure to let this simmer for 2 to five minutes. You'll have to play with how much stock you'll need. At the end you should have the full four cups mixed in.  When the noodles are done/ready, strain them and mix them in. Sorry if the instructions suck, I've never tried to write a recipe before and do a lot of cooking based on experience.

&amp;#x200B;

This turkey roll recipe was well liked and not much work. Be sure to make lots of stuffing. The stuffing recipe included here is unreal. Get a nice big dry rye loaf/pumpernickle and if you'd like, mix in some dry white of your choice. I never tried the gravy recipe here. I always make my own simple mix (explained above in the gravy bow tie recipe)

[http://www.cheftographer.com/vegan-turkey-roll/](http://www.cheftographer.com/vegan-turkey-roll/)

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, there are other simple things you can do to add festive flavours. Pick your favourite coleslaw/and/or potato salad recipe and toss in dry cranberries and if you can afford them (I usually skip expensive nut additions since things still taste great without them), chopped walnuts.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't tried this recipe yet but it looks great for side/dinner rolls. Check out these yorkshire puddings Avante Garde Vegan just posted.

Try some green beans, saute in vegan butter (or cooking oil and salt), tossed with cranberries as a simple side, or add mashed potatoes (I usually make a choice depending on how lazy I am whether to make a casserole like the scallops above). Or, if you want to get a little creative, try mashed rutabaga instead and keep the scallops around. Of course, this is lots of food. I'm essentially just listing things as I can think of them. Deep fried buffalo cauliflower wings are always a big hit but I usually avoid making them because I don't have a deep fryer. Hopefully the random stuff above helps.

2018-11,uglyduckling,1.0,"I highly recommend free weights since you have to engage balance muscles more than machines, but machines can be an excellent way to help break strength plateaus. Work on building your chest, shoulders and triceps using dumbells and superset with chest press machine. Ex) Dumbell chest press 8-15 reps immediately followed by Machine Chest press until failure. Building muscle and strength is all about volume and progressively increasing your weight over time. You can do this with basically any muscle group that you are struggling with, and if you really want to see results faster then add another day in the week where you do the same muscle group. For me personally, if I'm trying to hit chest hard I'll do a high volume day where I try to get as many reps as possible at a lower % of my Max strength and later do a strength day where I'll do like 5rep sets of heavy weight. You can use machines to your advantage on these days by really jacking up the weight and pushing yourself with lower chance of injury.  Be sure you track #set, #reps and weight and once you can do 12-15 reps per set you should bump weight up. Eventually you'll be strong enough to use the free bar no problem, don't worry, when I started I wasn't able to bench the bar either! Sorry I know that's a mess of info but let me know if you need clarification.

I've been really bad on my diet the past year haha, but when I'm focused here's my plan (keep in mind every person's body responds differently so tweak as necessary):

Cutting:
Macros -- nonlift day 40P/40F/20C -- lift day 40P/20F/40C
1,000kcal subtracted daily from TDEE (total daily energy expenditure -- can be found using online calculators)
Cut until roughly 13% BF

Bulking: 
Macros -- lift day 50C/30P/20F -- nonlift day -- 40C/40P/20F
+1,000kcal added to TDEE
Bulk until 18% BF roughly

Regardless of whether or not it's a lift day I always would make sure to eat 1g protein for every pound of lean muscle I have.

If you don't already have it, download MyFitnessPal. It's fucking awesome and crucial for accountability.

Ex meals and healthy foods I like) Grilled chicken with avocado and white rice, Greek yogurt, eggs, slow cooker BBQ pulled pork on a baked potato or sweet potato, baked french fries, baked panko buffalo cauliflower wings with Greek yogurt homemade ranch (surprisingly good!), Cauliflower crust pizza

Hopefully this helps! Let me know if you have any questions! I'm actually trying to motivate myself back into a cut so talking this through is helping me get back in the mindset haha. Best of luck to you and your SO!",1,1

  Breakfast (if eating): eggs and bacon with a side salad/mixed greens or a 3 egg omelette with tons of veggies (bell peppers, spinach, kale, mushrooms, zucchini, a little bit of onion or tomato) with of course some yummy cheese on (block cheese to avoid extra starch), sometimes I will make cream cheese keto pancakes, chia seed pudding, or ""oatmeal"" using hemp harts. 

  Lunch: almost always a salad loaded with fresh veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, bell pepper, mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini, brussel sprouts, green beans) olives, boiled egg, cheese, avocado, radishes, cucumbers and a protein (chicken, ham, bacon, turkey), and for dressing I usually do lemon and olive or avocado oil, sometimes I will do egg or tuna salad instead or add that on top of some greens or just eat leftovers from the previous night's dinner. 

  Dinner: a protein (ex grilled chicken, turkey burger, ground turkey, steak) veggie (see others above) and usually some type of dairy (block cheese, a small serving of sour cream). Sometimes I will do keto pizza with fathead dough or cauliflower crust, cream cheese stuffed jalapenos, egg roll in a bowel, ""keto casserole"" which is just basically any left over protein and veggies I have from meal prep with cheese and HWC baked casserole style, egg drop soup, zoodle pasta, buffalo cauliflower ""wings"", cauliflower ""mashed potatoes"", spaghetti squash pasta boats. 

  snacks: radishes, nuts (macadamia, pistachio, sunflower, brazil), avocado, quest bar (these are not technically completely keto I believe but I do like them on occasion when I am in a pinch), boiled eggs, pork rinds, cheese, meats, celery with almond butter, olives. 

  I also do a scope of collagen peptides, and usually incorporate 1 serving of chia seeds and psyllium husk in my water a day.

2018-11,GifRecipes,29.0,"**Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower** by [The Chew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uObjiTOaZ6Q)  

**INGREDIENTS:**  

 * 1 head cauliflower (cut into florets)   
 * 1 cup rice flour   
 * 1 cup water (more if necessary)   
 * 1 tablespoon garlic powder   
 * 1/2 teaspoon cayenne  
 * 2 teaspoons salt   
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper   
 * 2 cups panko breadcrumbs (for dredging)   
 * 1/3 cup hot sauce (or more to taste)   
 * Canola oil (for frying)   
 * Honey (to taste)   
 * Celery sticks (to serve)   
 * Blue cheese (to serve)   

**DIRECTIONS:**  

 1) Fill a heavy-bottomed pot or tabletop fry with canola oil and preheat to 350ºF.   

 2) In a large bowl, add the rice flour, water, garlic powder, cayenne, salt and black pepper. Whisk together to form a smooth batter.  

 3) Dip the cauliflower in the batter, making sure to coat each piece completely. Dredge in panko breadcrumbs. Deep fry until golden-brown about 4 minutes.   

 4) In a large bowl, add hot sauce and a drizzle of honey, stir to combine. Remove cauliflower from oil and place directly into bowl. Toss until completely coated.  

 5) Serve with celery sticks and blue cheese on the side.    


 *Tips:*   

 - The consistency of the batter should be like pancake batter. Make it ahead of time! Fry just before serving.   

 - To preserve the crunchy texture of the friend cauliflower, serve the hot sauce on the side and dip!   

 - If you don't have rice flour, use all-purpose flour.

2018-11,Showerthoughts,11.0,"Yeah but to most people those aren't ""vegan"" foods. They're just foods. They happen to be viable for vegans, great! The named segregation of food into ""vegan food"" and ""not vegan food"" is way more noticible than just having meals and vegans eating the food they like and non-vegans eating the food they like.

A big part of the ""How do you know someone's vegan? They'll tell you 60 times"" stigma comes from these few ""vegan"" foods that are just ""Vegan Buffalo Chicken Wings"" instead of ""Buffalo Cauliflower"". A lot of that has to do with the food industry trying to take advantage of mindshare to push products for vegans, but it definitely does contribute to it.

The biggest problem is that the foods that just have vegan stacked on the name of a traditional food are the most social foods. ""Hotdogs"", ""hamburgers"", ""chicken wings"", chilli ""con carne"", etc. Even if these foods are the smallest minority of foods, they're still the foods that non-vegans are going to experience the most exposure to, and the foods that they're most likely to experience vegan friends picking up at events when they go to hang out.",1,1

2018-03,vegetarian,7.0,"Be clear with yourself about whether you ""want to try being vegetarian"" or if you are doing it for specific purposes. If you're doing it for animal welfare, the environment, etc, and you have trouble going full vegetarian, or if you think you would, you could consider just reducing meat consumption. Half of America going vegan is the same as all of America halving its animal intake.

And if you want it to be a long-term thing, be honest with yourself. If it's too hard, just go for reducing meat consumption. If you find vegetarianism easy (or even fun), try going vegan! Just be true to your goals if they are the more serious ones like animal welfare or the environment.

**Anyway!** Pro Tips!

Don't try to find things that imitate meat itself imo. Go for things that fill the same satisfaction. Morningstar ""ground beef"" crumblers are clearly not meat when you try them, but they fill a similar satisfaction, at least for me.

Fake meats *in* dishes are usually better than fake meats on their own (bacon or something, sausage, etc)

**Chickpeas.** You can do a billion things with them. Bake them with seasoning in the oven all on their own, or make hummus, or have them in salads, or whatever.

Cauliflower too. You can make buffalo cauliflower ""wings."" Cauliflower rice or mashed potatoes. There's solid overlap in trend foods with being vegetarian. There's a solid overlap with the vegetarian community and people who get so into trend foods. It can be eye-rolling, but also convenient that lots of hyped up food ideas are also vegetarian.

**Stir fry.** You can put basically anything in it, from literally just broccoli and tofu with a store-bought sauce, to intricate like 5 or 7 or whatever ingredient dishes. There are a million recipes online, and you can improvise your own easily. Impossible to mess up too. It's super hard to overcook a stir fry to the point that it's *bad*.

Chinese/Asian food in general is or can be vegetarian.

Indian food really can be vegetarian- curries and whatnot especially. Many options.

Thai too. Also Greek or even Turkish food! Anything that gives me an excuse to eat Tzatziki is wonderful :&gt;

**Mexican! Tacos/burritos especially.** They're kind of like stir fry- so many different things can go in them, and you can have many or few ingredients. And there's lots more to Mexican food than just tacos or burritos.

Fast food - speaking of Mexican food, if you're looking for fast food, Taco Bell is really good for vegetarians. They have a ton of things where you can substitute refried beans for the beef. The company encourages vegetarians and meal modifications. If that appeals to you, hmu and I can give a lot of ideas/details. Burger king has a veggie burger. Virtually everything at McDonald's (including the fries!) are not vegetarian.

Lightlife ""smart dogs"" - vegan hot dogs and morningstar vegan chickn patties are my shit tbh. They're very close (imo) to replicating hot dogs and low-quality chicken patties. Two things I always liked when I ate meat.",1,1

I'll voice my opinion here not because I'm overly upset, but because I'm a loser with nothing better to do with my life. I mean isn't that why you're replying to my comments too? Or are you upset at me?

As far as why, it's mostly from an etymological standpoint. Vegan chicken wings aren't *chicken* wings so don't call them chicken wings. This is how words meaning gets fucked up over time and we wind up with different parts of the population that have miscommunications and misunderstandings.

But also from a standpoint of encouraging a wider audience to embrace vegan dishes, you discourage them by making these fako meals that subvert their expectations over the meals. As said before Buffalo Cauliflower is a fine dish, but the people who present it as Vegan Chicken Wings do the dish a disservice because people are going to go into it expecting it to be like chicken wings and get put off when it's not.

Ultimately what bugs me about it is how vegan culture subverts itself by making itself so unapproachable. But I guess the same is true about any culture. You have some people who are moderates and are open and accepting, but the loudest and most visible members are the annoying assholes who push everyone away.",1,1

Also you can incorporate veggies into your diet in sneakier ways, such as making cauliflower pizza, cauliflower rice, tossing spinach in a smoothie, etc. 

Lastly, some other ways to make veggies more eatable is to toss them in a giant stir fry orrr you can steam spinach and toss some raisins and lemon on top. Even if you’re not a huge spinach fan, steaming it makes a huge amount turn out to be very small so it’s easy to eat ",1,1

2018-06,iamveryculinary,9.0,"A lot of people get really up in arms about vegetarian (or god help you vegan) dishes that are based on or look like traditionally meat based dishes. I posted a picture of some (extremely delicious) buffalo cauliflower on /r/food not too long ago and while it was generally well received, there were still quite a few comments complaining about how it wasn't chicken. Like you can't bread, fry, and sauce vegetables too?",1,1
2018-04,AskReddit,1.0,"Chicken tendies! There are plenty of vegan brands out there. Buffalo cauliflower, you make a batter w nondairy milk and bake it in the oven. Delicious. Black bean burgers with barbecue sauce. I was never one for seafood/red meat, so I guess I got off pretty easy. ",1,1

2018-10,EatCheapAndHealthy,1.0,"You have to wean yourself off the junk. It's addicting and easy. Make the transition approachable by easing into it by first focusing on cooking food. Don't worry too much about how healthy or clean it is yet, start with just cooking all your meals from scratch. Then after you feel a little more comfortable with cooking, start focusing on making your meal plan healthier and healthier. 

Cooking can be really fun and it doesn't have to be hard. There's a ton of resources on super simple recipes and you can learn as you go. When in doubt, you can make a ton of great meals in the crockpot. I promise you can easily make meals just as appetizing at home as you find outside. 

Veggies can be bland or they can be the best part of the meal. 

* Roasting is my favorite way to cook veggies. It's easy and gives them a lot of flavor. Preheat the oven, chop the veggies and coat them in a layer of olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, (additional spices if desired- I do garlic powder sometimes). Pop in, take out after a while and move them around, put back in. I like to wait until they are noticeably browned. For some veggies you can add a layer of parmesan over them before baking them too, so good. Best with green beans and asparagus but zucchini and broccoli work too. 

* Grilling is good for a lot of flavor too

* You can incorporate them into dishes to kind of hide them. Like when making mashed potatoes, you could do half potatoes and half cauliflower. Layers of thin zucchini in your lasagna. Zucchini cornbread. 

* You can add a lot of them in places like casseroles, soups, stews, chilis, quiches, stirfry, etc. 

* Creamed spinach, cabbage coated in a honey vinaigrette and roasted, kale made into cripsy parmesan chips, honey glazed sautéed carrots, guacamole, spinach dip. veggie and cheese casserole, 

* You can do something like buffalo cauliflower. Cut the cauliflower up, coat it in buffalo sauce, and bake it. Serve with dip or even in a wrap or taco. 

For fruit, have you tried different types? There's so many and so many things you can do with them. You can start by trying a smoothie or making them into a dessert like strawberries and whipped cream. Banana pancakes might be a good idea too. 

For grains, it matters how you cook them too. Quinoa you need to rinse thoroughly before using it. And I always add chicken stock, seasonings, and parmesan for flavor.  I add canned tomatoes, sautéed onions, and black beans sometimes too. You can use them in quiches, you can make healthy fried rice with quinoa, use it to stuff peppers or zucchinis. 

You can try to find healthy substitutes for your favorite junk too. Do not expect it to be the same. But if you don't expect that, you can find it cures the craving just the same. 

I suggest getting a pinterest and browsing recipes on there. Find something you think looks good and give it a go. You can also try just googling ""cooking for beginners"" or something and see if there are some good blogs that are helpful. ",1,1

2018-07,vegan,6.0,"Way wayyyy back in the day, like 2012/13, for such a brief moment in time, there was this vegan chef Jason Wrobel Who had a cooking show and featured some pretty good dishes, it was the first time I ever learned about buffalo cauliflower or using cauliflower at all as a substitute for anything. I was just getting into veganism around 19 or 20 and my mom saw him and suggested that we try to make something from his show. it meant a lot to me because I was having a hard time getting the point across to my family that this was important to me. I don’t know when it stopped airing, but I hope he’s still active somewhere. ",1,1

Fuck yeah buffalo cauliflower",1,1
2018-02,recipes,1.0,"Buffalo cauliflower is a huge hit in our house (my fiancé is gluten free and we mostly eat vegetarian, if not vegan). 

* Cut the cauliflower head into reasonable size pieces (what would take a couple bites if you ate it raw, they’ll shrink quite a bit). 
*Season and bake the cauliflower at 400F for ~20 minutes, turning half way through
* Meanwhile, melt some vegan butter replacement (Earth Balance is great) with a cayenne pepper sauce (e.g., Frank’s Red Hot) - be sure to stir a lot. Get the fat and the sauce to combine well
*Pull out cauliflower and toss with the sauce. 
* Optional - I like to put it back in the oven for a few minutes to heat back through for about 10 minutes, and then broil on high for 3 minutes to caramelize a bit.

Of course, you can bake the cauliflower initially with some gluten free flour (there’s loads to choose from), so that they crisp up a bit.

Good luck!",1,1

2018-06,StLouis,5.0,"OMG, finally something I can comment on that I have some expertise with!

Grocery Stores:

Aldis
Trader Joes (Multiple Locations)
Fresh Thyme (Multiple Locations)
Whole Foods (Multiple Locations)
Golden Grocer Natural Foods (Central West End)
New Dawn Natural Foods (Tower Grove South)
Local Harvest Grocery (Tower Grove South)
River City Natural Foods Market (Kirkwood)

Food Trucks:
Le Camoin Bistro (tell the owner I sent you)
Bombay Food Junkies (Indian cuisine)

Restaurants:
Lulu's Local Eatery (Tower Grove South)
Tree House Restaurant (Tower Grove South)
Pizza Head (Tower Grove South)
Frida's (University City)
Big Sky Cafe (Webster Groves)
Gokul Indian Restaurant (Delmar Loop)

These are just the places that come to mind that have the most vegan options or that are dedicated vegan joints. Honestly, the Grove is just the happening place for vegans. I love going to Lulu's, getting some vegan Gelato at Gelateria Del Leone, then heading on over to Dunaway Books for some amazing finds to add to my collection. 

Most Thai and Indian places in town have vegan options, and most Chinese places will have a good Buddha's delight. The suburbs are a bit vegan dry, but the Kirkwood and Ferguson farmer's market are great trips to make during the right seasons for produce. I think the Kirkwood farmers market might still have vegan pies but I haven't been in town for a while.

Frida's and Big Sky Cafe are very upscale- not overpriced, just very nice and a little more of a treat than the other places I listed. Lulu's has the best buffalo cauliflower bites and jackfruit tacos. They will blow your mind. Tree House has some specialties like vegan Lox, which is nuts and super cool. 

I hope this is helpful to you, if you have any other questions, PM me and I can hoepfully answer them! Enjoy your time in St. Louis!
