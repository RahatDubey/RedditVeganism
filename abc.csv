Sure, the company sucks, but if it helps someone turn to veganism, then that’s awesome. Someone may start as a “fast food vegan” and move to be more plant-based over time as they become more comfortable. 

I hope more large companies provide vegan options so the world can see what’s possible. I’m blown away by how many people don’t know burgers (and pretty much anything else) can be vegan.

vegan,138,"I think it’s mainly misinformation, but that’s my own bias. 

People tend to get riled up over two things: PETA kidnaps pets, and they have a high kill rate at their shelter. The first is a misrepresentation, there were two occasions where low level employees took someone’s pet while PETA was out gathering strays. Both of those occasions were tragic. However, PETA fires the employees and cooperated with the investigation both times. People believe that is part of PETA’s operation, but it seems more likely to me that some crazy people worked for them and went too far. 

As for the kill rate, PETA runs “shelters of last resort.” So many of their pets have been sent to PETA by other shelters specifically because those pets were not adoptable. PETA also has a free euthanasia program for low income people, so that drives their kill rate up. 

I think the circlejerk is that those facts make an animal welfare organization hypocritical. I disagree, because I think their goal is to reduce the animal’s suffering, and terminating for end of life care is one way to do that. ",0

* 1 cup VWG
* 3 tbsp all purpose flour
* 2 tbsp mushroom powder
* 1 ½ tsp salt
* 1 ½ tbsp maple syrup
* ½ tsp 5 spice
* ½ tsp black pepper
* 5 tbsp olive oil
* ½ cup water and 1 small to medium beet blended together

Knead together to form ball of dough (I instead blended everything together in the food processor, and I needed a few tbsp more VWG than it called for).
Coat the outside with a mixture of beefless seasoning, peppercorns/pickling spice, and chili flakes. Wrap with plastic wrap and let sit for several hours – a day. 

Make the broth for cooking.

* 5 cups water
* 2 bay leaves
* 4 -5 cloves garlic smashed
* 2 -3 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp salt
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp mustard seeds
* 1 ½ tsp all spice berries
* 1 tbsp jerk seasoning
* 1 tbsp beefless seasoning

Bring broth to a boil and then simmer on low heat. Wrap seitan in a cheesecloth, add to broth and cook covered for 30 mins. Then into a 275 F oven covered for 1 ½ hours. (I wrapped the seitan tighter in the cheesecloth than Connie did but I should have done another layer or two and pulled it even tighter because the outside got a little spongey. Or maybe I'll try foil wrapped next time?)

Add seitan to a hot oiled pan. Drizzle with maple syrup and mustard, sprinkle with black pepper and add a few drops of liquid smoke. Flip and repeat with the other side. (I did this twice for either side)

Coat the outside with a mixture of beefless seasoning, peppercorns/pickling spice, and chili flakes. Wrap with plastic wrap and let sit for several hours – a day. 

Make the broth for cooking.

* 5 cups water
* 2 bay leaves
* 4 -5 cloves garlic smashed
* 2 -3 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp salt
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp mustard seeds
* 1 ½ tsp all spice berries
* 1 tbsp jerk seasoning
* 1 tbsp beefless seasoning

Bring broth to a boil and then simmer on low heat. Wrap seitan in a cheesecloth, add to broth and cook covered for 30 mins. Then into a 275 F oven covered for 1 ½ hours. (I wrapped the seitan tighter in the cheesecloth than Connie did but I should have done another layer or two and pulled it even tighter because the outside got a little spongey. Or maybe I'll try foil wrapped next time?)

Add seitan to a hot oiled pan. Drizzle with maple syrup and mustard, sprinkle with black pepper and add a few drops of liquid smoke. Flip and repeat with the other side. (I did this twice for either side) 

THEN WAIT. Throw it in the fridge and wait. Seitan is always better the next day!",0

vegan,123,"I mean I’m gonna throw this out there, euthanization is a mercy once an animal’s health degrades to a certain degree.  I’ve seen someone keep a dog that couldn’t walk, needed force fed, and just went to the bathroom on itself until they cleaned it up.  The dog was unable to do anything a dog enjoys and had no quality of life.

I also think that getting animals spayed/neutered is a great thing to help with overpopulation.  I’ve had a hysterectomy myself.  I was miserable a little while but got over it and life is fine.  It also reduces the risk of certain cancers in animals.

In select situations abortions for an animal make sense.  Not just because of overpopulation, but because some breeds can literally die if they take a litter to term (which is a large part that breeders charge so much for small dogs).  My aunt has a yorkie.  The dogs mother died in delivery, the other puppies all died, the only one that survived was the one my aunt has.  All in all 4 dogs died when they didn’t have to-because someone wanted this dog to have puppies.  It’s sad.  

In the case of feral cats, where I live if they get pregnant in the winter the kittens can easily freeze to death.  To spay/neuter a stray cat means an abortion.  We can all say well just keep the cat until she delivers and has the kittens etc etc.  Unfortunately there are too many feral cats to meet this demand.  Therefore the abortion is a better option.  Not just that, but feral cats cause havoc to birds.  22 species in North America have specifically been hunted to extinction-by cats. 

Now all that said I see no reason a vet can’t be vegan.  Of all the things where there are situations like the above where there are grey areas or justifications, veganism is not one of those things.",0

I was however involved in the branding, etc, process, which was totally cool and not at all a horrible experience for just-a-few-months-old calves.

Then we let them up, still smelling of burnt hair and skin with small rivers of blood beginning to clot on their heads, and let them go back to their moms, telling ourselves none of that ever hurt them and they were only distressed because they didn’t like being held down or being kept away from mom.

vegan,131,"I think it’s mainly misinformation, but that’s my own bias. 

People tend to get riled up over two things: PETA kidnaps pets, and they have a high kill rate at their shelter. The first is a misrepresentation, there were two occasions where low level employees took someone’s pet while PETA was out gathering strays. Both of those occasions were tragic. However, PETA fires the employees and cooperated with the investigation both times. People believe that is part of PETA’s operation, but it seems more likely to me that some crazy people worked for them and went too far. 

As for the kill rate, PETA runs “shelters of last resort.” So many of their pets have been sent to PETA by other shelters specifically because those pets were not adoptable. PETA also has a free euthanasia program for low income people, so that drives their kill rate up.

Male calves are sent to the slaughterhouse where they’re turned into veal, female calves are raised to be dairy cows. When their milk dries up, they’re sent to slaughter too. Usually that’s when they’re around 6 years old (out of a 20 year natural lifespan).

vegan,122,"I mean I’m gonna throw this out there, euthanization is a mercy once an animal’s health degrades to a certain degree.  I’ve seen someone keep a dog that couldn’t walk, needed force fed, and just went to the bathroom on itself until they cleaned it up.  The dog was unable to do anything a dog enjoys and had no quality of life.

I also think that getting animals spayed/neutered is a great thing to help with overpopulation.  I’ve had a hysterectomy myself.  I was miserable a little while but got over it and life is fine.  It also reduces the risk of certain cancers in animals.

In select situations abortions for an animal make sense.  Not just because of overpopulation, but because some breeds can literally die if they take a litter to term (which is a large part that breeders charge so much for small dogs).  My aunt has a yorkie.  The dogs mother died in delivery, the other puppies all died, the only one that survived was the one my aunt has.  All in all 4 dogs died when they didn’t have to-because someone wanted this dog to have puppies.  It’s sad.  

In the case of feral cats, where I live if they get pregnant in the winter the kittens can easily freeze to death.  To spay/neuter a stray cat means an abortion.  We can all say well just keep the cat until she delivers and has the kittens etc etc.  Unfortunately there are too many feral cats to meet this demand.  Therefore the abortion is a better option.  Not just that, but feral cats cause havoc to birds.  22 species in North America have specifically been hunted to extinction-by cats.

https://www.mnn.com/family/pets/videos/george-pig-helping-give-piglet-second-chance

'George the pig was riding in a truck in January, going down Interstate 35 in Des Moines, Iowa, heading towards a slaughterhouse.

He escaped the truck, but he was badly injured in the process. Luckily, Iowa Farm Sanctuary was notified and rushed to save him.

After getting care at an animal hospital, George found a new home at the sanctuary, but he had a hard time adjusting to normal pig life because of the conditions he'd faced in his previous life.

It left him feeling lonely. But that changed when he met Guy.

The 21-day-old piglet had also fallen off a truck and was rescued in early March. Iowa Farm Sanctuary took him in and began a search for a more permanent home for him.

Guy was also injured from his incident and refused to eat, which worried his caretakers. But they discovered that the little piglet just wanted a friend's support.

Guy walked into George's room and stood in the elder pig's food bowl — and began eating his food with him!

It was clear the two pigs enjoyed each other's company, and since that day, they've been inseparable.

Guy now has an Uncle George he can spend time with and learn from, and George has a best friend.

With their tight bond so apparent, the sanctuary is working to raise funds to help make their facilities a permanent home for both pigs so they can keep their friendship going'.

I’m kind of upset that cauliflower has become such a staple of my diet. It’s like, I don’t really enjoy eating the cauliflower itself all that much. It’s pretty flavorless. But the breading and the mixture of flavors that come with it are great. Cauliflower wings with mashed potatoes and gravy? I eat that shit constantly. 

But when I bite into the califlower I’m disappointed that it’s not something with more flavor. I’m happy it’s healthy, it’s a good way to get some veggies in a meal that wouldn’t normally be as healthy, but I want some flavor man. And cauliflower wings are everywhere. In other meals there are things like tofu or jackfruit or some of that dope new magical vegan food like beyond burgers and whatnot, and eating all of it is so exciting and interesting and delicious. I keep coming back to cauliflower wings because of that breading and that delicious gravy and mashed potates. 

I wish that there was a well known chicken substitute for vegans other than cauliflower. I went to this restaurant in Albuquerque NM recently called Heritage Thai Vegan and they had the most incredible chicken substitute. Their chicken satay was mana from heaven, and I ordered some bomb vegan chicken nuggets from that May Wah Online Asian Market site as well. What I’m saying is Asians are holding the secrets to chicken substitute deliciousness and we should be deciphering their ancient texts as well as helping Silicon Valley usher in the future of vegan food now. Anyway, thanks for reading my ramblings I should go now as I’m getting a might bit peckish and I think I have some “shrimp” from May Wah in my freezer that I need to try.",0

vegan,109,"There's a website literally named [petakillsanimals.com](https://petakillsanimals.com) which promotes all these talking points we hear again and again.

The site is created and maintained by the [CCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Organizational_Research_and_Education), which is a lobbying group [funded](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=CCF_funding) by major food and agriculture corporations. That website is a way for Wendy's to tell you that PETA is evil for euthanising animals, so you should ignore their arguments and come on down to enjoy their new Made to Crave range of meat products.

These corporations are not funding this because they want to help animals in shelters. It is a stated aim of the CCF to work against ""animal rights extremism"" (such as not needlessly killing billions of them.) They want to take down animal rights and vegan movements in any way they can. They put out a lot of [TV, radio and print ads](https://www.consumerfreedom.com/advocacy/) to do that, as well as being the source for many of the [press releases](https://www.consumerfreedom.com/category/animal-rights/) that end up becoming stories on the news.

I always find this argument to be really weird. Like just because the animal agriculture industry exists doesn't mean I am obligated to support it. There are many industries that don't get my support, whether I agree with them or not. Are your parents farmers?

Are your parents into photography? If not they don't care about the photography industry.

Do your parents go to sporting events and watch them on TV? If not they don't care about the sports industry.

Are your parents welders? If not they don't care about the steel industry.

And so on. Hundreds of industries exist that get varied amounts of support. No one has any obligation to support any one of them.

vegan,162,"yea I'm really not a fan of the fact that veganism is getting increasingly co-opted to be a consumer identity - it's yet another case of capitalist recuperation declawing a radical movement into something that is profitable. It's reducing the situation to a dichotomy of two competing consumer identities - ""vegan"" and ""meat eater"". The two sides are effectively in what amounts to a sort of war - and since it is a consumer identity the way of ""winning"" this war is to consume more of the ""right"" things - to buy more vegan stuff, including vegan merch, vegan mugs, vegan t-shirts or on the flipside, meat, as well as anti-vegan mugs and t-shirts. This allows capitalists to sell ""weapons"" to both sides - selling ammunition to vegans to attack meat eaters with while at the same time selling ammunition to anti-vegans to do the reverse. Suddenly, instead of fighting those that actually have the power that they use to exploit humans and animals alike, we're fighting eachother and the movement is rendered harmless to the capitalists, including the meat industry.

Veganism should not just be a diet, it shouldn't just be a consumer choice, it's about reducing and ultimately ending the exploitation of animals. Reducing and eliminating your own personal consumption of animal products is just a part of this. A necessary part, yes, but don't mistake consuming the right shit for some kind of radical activism that's going to bring about an end to exploitation.",1

That's a show animal that's been meticulously groomed so that backwards old fucks like my dad can poke and ogle at their butts and loins and fantasize about how much money they'll make at slaughter and whether they should make the poor thing's parents fuck again.

I used to show lambs. The things we did and that other showmen do are nothing short of abuse. Chaining them to tables for hours at a time, dragging them by their heads to ""break"" them so they'll handle for show, bottle feeding and drenching and starving them to get rid of their perfectly normal 'hay gut' so they'll look like one great big flexed bicep on legs.

Then, if they're lucky, and a dude thinks they have the nicest looking butt, they're drug into an auction pit, ogled at some more, and bid upon like slaves. Big shots will then run each other up to make themselves 'stand out' in the community and earn a reputation for being 'friendly to our local farmers'. 

That's all it's for, 'cause the animal's carcass tastes like shit. You think that after all the 'training' and nutritional abuse the creature suffers to get showy 'fake tits' for muscles that they're going to taste good? No! They're lean, they're stringy, they're gray, and they taste nothing like animal that's been allowed to eat what it wants, wander where it likes, and lay down whenever it wants to and have a peaceful life.

Not to mention that without the wool and with all the grease washed out of their skin, they're open to fungal infections, biting flies, and injuries from rubbing against things in their enclosures. It's such a problem that we have to put drugs and pesticides and blankets on them to keep it from happening.

Take what you know about bodybuilding and what bodybuilders do for shows (drugs included, sometimes), then have a sadistic circus trainer that calls himself a farmer do it to a scared young animal that did nothing worse than have a nice-looking butt. ***That's*** how you get what's on the left.

vegan,389,"Since this is about to get a lot of attention and we may get some r/all participants in this thread, let me lay out and address some of the arguments for hunting:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Hunting is natural and sustainable.*

Humans and the livestock we raise make up 96% of mammal biomass on earth \[[Source](https://www.ecowatch.com/biomass-humans-animals-2571413930.html)\]. Wild mammals make up 4%. There is no sustainable way to bring meat to the table to 8 billion people without factory farming, which is itself massively unsustainable in a multitude of other ways. If the world hunted for their food, we would have no wild mammals left in a matter of months. Hunting is ""sustainable"" because so few people actually hunt for their meat.

Take deer for example. North America has roughly 40 million deer \[[Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiki5nZvP_fAhVyh-AKHUfeDdQQFjABegQIARAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrophiccascades.forestry.oregonstate.edu%2Fsites%2Ftrophic%2Ffiles%2FCrete%25201999.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2kcxJM-zlkDDHBQOqx1Mg-)\]. How long do you think that would sustain the population of North America, which is nearing 600 million people and growing? Hunting is not anywhere near a solution for feeding the world. The last time humans primarily hunted for their diet (before 8000 BCE), the global human population was on the order of 1-2 million \[[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_estimates)\]. And even then, humans **frequently** hunted large species of mammals to extinction.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Hunting license fees go directly toward forest and wildlife management and conservation.*

If they cared about forest and wildlife management, hunters would donate this money instead or be in favor of raising taxes to fund those organizations. Hunters just want to hunt. I can think of no more a hypocritical way to ""enjoy and preserve the outdoors"" than enacting my violence upon it for no other good reason than ""I like to hunt."" Most hunters live within a stone's throw of a grocery store.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Hunting keeps pest population in check.*

This is correct to a degree. Natural predators do this much better than we can ever hope to achieve. Pest populations can often become out of control in suburban areas. This has become a frequent issue in areas of the southeast United States for no other reason than we eliminated their natural predators. Take Yellowstone National Park for example: when wolves were reintroduced to the park after being hunted out, it brought an ecological balance and solved issues that had plagued the park for decades \[[Source](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140128-how-wolves-saved-a-famous-park)\]. 

The primary reason for eliminating these natural predators is to protect our livestock. Rabbit populations plague farmers when predators like foxes and weasels are hunted out of the area to protect chickens and other fowl. Animal agriculture has caused this ""need"" for humans to perform population control through hunting, and everything about the cycle is a result of us enforcing our human will on the natural world in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*I enjoy being in nature and the thrill of hunting.*

Then I have an awesome new hobby for you hunters: **wildlife photography**. It captures the same essence of hunting, minus the violence. You get a ""trophy"" in the form of pictures you take. It requires patience and extended time spent in a natural setting. As far as I know, there are no restrictions on taking photos of any species at any time of the year, unlike hunting. Photographing a deer well is going to be much more of a challenge than shooting it.

&gt;The ""identifiable victim effect"" refers to the tendency of individuals to offer greater aid when a specific, identifiable person (""victim"") is observed under hardship, as compared to a large, vaguely defined group with the same need. The effect is also observed when subjects administer punishment rather than reward.

&amp;#x200B;

There's different opinions on what you do with the eggs once you already have the chickens, but the one part where there's agreement is how you get the chicken.

&amp;#x200B;

If you buy her, that's not vegan. The egg laying hen industry has no use for the males, and they almost always are killed early. If you rescue her, that's a different issue. My opinion is that you shouldn't eat her eggs at first, and see what she does with them. It takes a ton of nutrients to produce an egg, and chickens regularly eat their own eggs to regain those nutrients. But some chickens don't eat their own eggs, and if you've given them that opportunity I see no real issue with taking and eating the eggs.

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue would be why you rescued the hen. If it was specifically for the purpose of getting eggs, that wouldn't be vegan. But if it was for the purpose of having a cool chicken friend to hang out with that would be pretty fuckin vegan.",0

vegan,115,"Tyson Brand's chicken protein rendering plant (formerly American Proteins) in Hanceville spilled hundreds of thousands of gallons of chicken rendering waste late last week. This sent E. coli and algae levels skyrocketing, resulting in a crash in dissolved oxygen, trashing over 40 miles of the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River and killing just about everything that can't breath air. Gar and Bowfin, capable of breathing via ""air gulping,"" survived. I was out on the river on Tuesday and saw tens of thousands of dead fish of at least 17 species, covering 15 miles of the affected area. From tiny minnows and darters to huge 40+ lb catfish and carp, this was death on an unimaginable scale. There are recent records of Flattened Musk Turtles (Federally Threatened) from this very section of the Mulberry, and is part of the native range of the Black Warrior Waterdog (Federally Endangered). While no turtles were observed to have died immediately after the spill, this very well could have crashed the aquatic snails and bivalves that they rely on for food. If there were any waterdogs left in this section of river, then they are almost certainly dead.




Proactive repairs at this plant have been chronically neglected for decades. They fix things after they fail catastrophically and wipe out vast swathes of wildlife downstream. This is an event that reoccurs every few years at this plant. This time it was an old pipe that busted.

She went home and I carried on travelling alone, I would treat myself to the occasional burger but not very often. I then went to visit her in Korea and attended a dog meat protest in Seoul. It was then that I realised my hypocrisy that I was stood there in some charities t-shirt with banners totally against the dog meat industry but I ate cow flesh a week or so ago? I wondered how many people there were even vegan/vegatarian or just liked dogs. What made me Uber paranoid was that because I was the only white guy at this protest, the film crew and photographers were taking heaps of photos and videos of me specifically and trying to get me into a more central position in the protest. Probably trying to use me in future promos. Imagine then someone saw me later that evening at a Korean BBQ or something. I would have been so embarrassed so vowed at that point to fully convert, not just due to potential embarrassment but it just made things click in my head. I haven't eaten meat since, I've had a couple of dairy slip ups in the past year but am kinda past that now also.

Also another reinforcing factor was that after this I got an English teaching job in Vietnam where there is also a tradition of eating dog meat. I would be sat at the dinner table at a place shared by many western teachers where they all angrily speak about the eating of dog meat and how Vietnamese are 'animals' and 'babaric' for eating dog, oblivious to their own hypocrisy as they are happily eating pork right now which probably has had as inhumane life and death in this 3rd world country with it's limited animal abuse laws as the dogs they care about so much.

vegan,324,"this community is definitely changing a lot lately. can't say it's been changing for the better though. 

Sometimes I wonder if I am blocked or silenced on r/vegan because I'll make a post and it doesn't even show up (when I sort by new) or it'll show up like 4 hours after I post it. 

Also, it's beginning to feel like babysitting here. I get a lot of people who have been vegan for a whopping 6 days telling me to ""be more kind"" towards vegetarians or ""show more empathy"" towards ""struggling vegans"" who still eat eggs or dairy.

I mentioned my interest in veganism to my ex a long time ago. She was the biggest self-proclaimed animal lover I've ever met. To the point where she would refuse to watch a movie with an animal in the first scene because ""it might die and I can't handle that."" Yes, we even walked out of the theatre once. She was 100% against the idea of NOT eating the same animals though.",0

vegan,310,"People want so badly to attribute some stereotype to Veganism, so they do - often several contradictory ones at once. In reality, Veganism can embody any number of character traits. Most importantly, though, Veganism can be average.

Picture someone that likes to think they generally eat healthy, but they also indulge now and then. They bring sandwiches to work. They like pasta. They try to get their fruits and veggies in but still have a pint of ice cream in the freezer. They try to get regular exercise, but have trouble committing to a plan because they’re so busy at work. They’re not health nuts or foodies, hippies or hipsters. They’re pretty typical. That CAN be Veganism. Veganism can be ‘average’ or ‘normal.’ You just have to let go of the stereotypes.",0
vegan,242,"A little about me! 

I made an attempt to try vegetarianism at 21 years old. My sister had been a vegan for YEARS and opened up to me about how sad she was that she didn’t have any veggie/vegan friends to share her thoughts and experiences with. Prior to that, I was a typical Omni...Meats, cheeses, only ate veggies/fruits to have a balanced diet. I teased my sister about her diet and lifestyle like most A-holes do. But, I did it. I gave up meat. I did it cold turkey. Meat was easy. It took me 8 months to swap to veganism, but I haven’t looked back since. I beat myself up for not doing it sooner. I am in love with how I look and feel. There’s been periods of my life where I feel infinitely stronger and faster than when I had an omnivore diet.

I have been in the Air Force 7 years, so I have been spreading the word for a long time. I get a lot of flak for my diet and lifestyle. Which is okay, because I kick ass on my PT Tests and am constantly probably one of the most fit people in the unit. The reason I point out being in the military is that I have been able to have a handful of people try vegetarianism and veganism just because they know someone who lives the life. I do my best to maintain a vegan lifestyle when I am deployed and overseas. It has only gotten easier as time goes on. 

Just trying my best to be a vegan advocate in an environment where people often ridicule us. An advocate for the people who think they can’t sustain the diet or lifestyle. Thank you for the support. I am so happy I found this sub on reddit. Love y’all. ������

Edit: Guys, I just wanted to thank you for introducing me to Magnet Fishing. At first I thought you meant those little plastic fish with a magnet in the mouth, like the fisher-price thing lol. So I wasn't expecting much when I googled it. This is soooo incredible - You get the subculture and network, the gear, the thrill of a ""catch"", you're not hurting an animal and you're cleaning their habitat. I've lost sleep at this point watching videos and googling the best magnets lol. The barrier to entry is awesome, it's actually cheaper than buying a rod and tackle and all that stuff. I'm going to buy a set-up today, and by this weekend, I'll be magnet fishing!",0

vegan,267,"&gt;When I first saw this image, I momentarily mistook it for a cemetery, one of those filled with long, neat rows of unmarked graves or “unknowns.” How fitting, then, that what it actually is is a photo of dairy calves in hutches. Calves born to dairy cows are torn from their mothers within hours of birth, in order for humans to steal the milk intended for them. Male calves are sold to auction to be slaughtered for veal or cheap beef, while female calves are typically raised in “calf hutches,” little plastic igloos or dog-house-type structures with a few feet of fenced in dirt in front. They live this way, in complete isolation, for the first 2 to 3 months of their lives. They do not leave the hutches to run or play, and in order to prevent the possibility of young calves spreading sickness amongst themselves (a potential profit loss), they are not even allowed to touch each other. This, during the time when they are most in need of touch, most of all from their own mothers, with whom they would normally be grazing, nuzzling, and experiencing the greatest bond any mammal ever knows.

vegan,397,"Disclaimer: My massive weight loss wasn’t directly attributed to veganism.  But I attribute veganism to the fact that I havent gotten back to being severely obese or diabetic again.  I had diabetes almost requiring the use of insulin. I was taking medication for diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and I was only 29 when I had to begin consulting a nephrologist because it appeared I may have had the beginnings of kidney disease. 

A year after the weight loss, I started seeing my weight progressively getting higher, and my blood sugar and blood pressure starting going back up as well.  Going vegan helped me bring those numbers back down and will help me keep them down for the rest of my life.  I want to make sure I’ll be able to see my kids grow up.  Going vegan is the best insurance policy I could give myself.

EDIT: My blood sugar is actually typically in the low 90s.  This was the only picture I found though. I don’t have my glucometer anymore. Gave it and my diabetic supplies to someone else who needed it more.

EDIT2:  Failed to mention one more thing - I have had all my prescriptions discontinued. EVERYTHING is considered “resolved” (diabetes, hypertension, hyoercholesterolemia, poor kidney function, and sleep apnea all resolved.  Also since going vegan and dairy-free, my eczema and psoriasis has dramatically improved.  My eczema used to be so bad I’d attempt to wear foundation to hide the stark redness).

EDIT3:  Can’t believe how fast this post got. Thank you to everyone!!! If a moderator sees this, can I get a “vegan nurse” title?

EDIT4:  Clarification - my diet wasn’t STRICTLY meat before. Word choice was poor. But it was definitely little to zero vegetables. And very little fruit. Hated vegetables and avoided them as much as I could. I’m still learning to enjoy some of them but my intake is definitely 20-30x more fruits and vegetables than what I took in before. I previously was, as my wife described it, a garbage disposal.  I just ate everything in site that wasn’t fruits or vegetables.  After I lost the weight and saw it creeping back up again, I knew I had to do something. I was tired of doing the same thing over and over again - yo-yo dieting.  I decided to just try a vegan diet. Just one day, cold turkey, I stopped eating meat, dairy, and eggs.  Told myself “I’ll just do this for 7 days”.  Well, 7 days past and I never stopped.  I just felt better and I kept going.  Weight stabilized and went back down. Blood pressure went back to normal. FSBS went back to normal. Skin cleared up way more times than it did before. Energy felt more stable.  It’s this way of living for everyone? I don’t know. I just know it works for me.   I kept going, learned more about CAFOs and the environmental impact of the industry.  Those other reasons are now whether tethers me to continue this.  I don’t know what I’ll be doing a year or so from now but at this point I CANNOT even picture myself going back to eating meat - this guy, the one who BBQ’d like crazy, the one who would watch family kill a pig to cook LECHON, the guy who was way more excited than he should have been for the DOUBLE-DOWN chicken sandwich from KFC, the guy whose favorite oil to cook with was bacon oil.  Something had to change and I made my change.  If someone, ANYONE, may be experience what I experience whether bariatric pre-op or post-op, I felt it was worth sharing.  Surgery was just a way for me to start from the beginning again.  

It doesn’t matter if you can reset the game, you can still screw up a game save if you keep making the same wrong decisions.  I just decided to make different ones. Now I’m further along in the game than I ever been.",0
vegan,499,"Relevant paper:

&gt;Many people like eating meat, but most are reluctant to harm things that have minds. The current three studies show that this dissonance motivates people to deny minds to animals. Study 1 demonstrates that animals considered appropriate for human consumption are ascribed diminished mental capacities. Study 2 shows that meat eaters are motivated to deny minds to food animals when they are reminded of the link between meat and animal suffering. Finally, Study 3 provides direct support for our dissonance hypothesis, showing that expectations regarding the immediate consumption of meat increase mind denial. Moreover, this mind denial in turn reduces negative affect associated with dissonance. The findings highlight the role of dissonance reduction in facilitating the practice of meat eating and protecting cultural commitments.

Scully's story:

'At 12.30pm on January 30th, 2015 I received a phone call. The caller was upset, she said “This place is disgusting Tam. There’s swarms of flies everywhere. There’s pig skeletons. It’s horrific”. I hung up with a heavy heart with images of intensive piggeries I’d visited in the past in my mind. Ten minutes later I got another call – “I’m on the way to your house. I have a pig. She’s so sick”.

I looked into the back seat of the car to see a pale, emaciated pig looking back at me. She had sores all over her body. She had massive wounds on each ear. She was incredibly small for her age. She had a septic, open wound on her back left hock. Her ribs were showing. Even though she felt so incredibly sick, she still acknowledged me when I patted her and then she looked up to the sky and smiled.

My friend carried her into the vet consultation room that they had prepared just for us. Her first tentative steps on the floor made her slightly confused because of it’s slippery texture, but she didn’t take long to get used to it. She was off wandering around the room, looking under the desk and checking out the bin before we knew it. She was quite wary of us at first. She looked at us with a querying looking in her eyes and wasn’t too happy to have us put her hands out to her. 

She walked around, keeping a close eye on us for about ten minutes and then all of a sudden she decided that we were ok, that we weren’t going to hurt her and that she would accept our offer of friendship. Her decision then saw her start giving us kisses with her snout. For such an abused, sickly pig to trust us so quickly was heart warming and a testament to how clever these animals are and how their ability to read energy is so very strong.

Her wounds were dressed. She was treated for worms and mange. She was given heavy duty antibiotics and she was booked in for a full body check over under anaesthetic in two days time. Her prognosis was “All we can do is try. We’ll try” but it was said with an undertone of “please be prepared, she’s an incredibly sick little pig”.

On the way home she sparked up considerably and the decision was made to put the child locks on the doors of the car because she was so smart that she was trying to open the doors. We did notice that she would take food, but was unable to actually swallow it. 

Whilst she was under anaesthetic a few days later, the vet found a large tumour in her throat. Whether it was malignant or benign was unknown at that stage. She was put on medication in hope it would shrink. She then started to eat food and really enjoy it.

She spent the next four days learning about her new life, making friends and being loved. She learnt how to open every door in the house. She taught her carer how to know she was asking for food. Her carer expressed the following thoughts about Scully –

“The thing that really stands out for me was how incredibly human-like she was in her intelligence, awareness and emotions. It seems sadly strange that we spend so much time wondering if we’re the only intelligent creatures in the universe, and yet we co-exist on this earth with animals like pigs. 

She recognised there was a verbal communication barrier between us, so she taught me how to understand her and her needs. Everything else was conveyed with tenderness and affection. She loved the other animals – she played with the kitten as we would. She recognised he was only a baby and she adjusted her behaviour to play with him as an adult would a child. She learnt very quickly how to manipulate and navigate through her environment. I didn’t teach her. She learnt – or it appeared obvious to her. “

Early on a Tuesday morning ( February 4, 2015) Scully left the world unexpectedly. Her little body just couldn’t cope and couldn’t go on. The vet surmised that she died from a heart attack, which would have come about from internal bleeding which was going on for some time and the huge infection her body was trying to fight. In her 4.5 days of freedom she experienced more than any farmed pig ever does. She charmed the world.

Right now, in Australia, more than 5 million pigs are trapped in intensive piggeries. 

Each one of these pigs is an individual just like Scully was. 

How can you help? 

Stop purchasing animal products. These farms exist directly because of consumer demand. 

Please choose kindness when you eat. You don’t need to eat individuals like Scully.

vegan,191,"I thought beekeeping was ""helpful"" to the bee problem, too. Turns out, beekeeping is a (possibly major) contributing factor into why we have this problem in the first place. Beekeepers bring non-native bees into new areas, where they compete with the local bee populations, causing die offs. The beekept populations tend to be very genetically undiverse (sourced from the same strains) and are therefore much more susceptible to die offs themselves due to disease, etc.

All that aside, bees make honey for themselves, not us. We take their life's work (3 bees life's work = 1/4 teaspoon of honey), and replace it with an inferior substitute, causing further health issues. The queen's wings are frequently clipped to prevent her from leaving, and many beekeepers find it more ""economically viable"" to let the entire hive die off over the winter in colder climates, and just buy new bees in the spring.

If we really care about bee survival, we need to stop fucking with them and stealing their food.",0

He got us to watch a video of a pig being castrated/docked without anesthetic (the way it is typically done on a farm).

Veganism is for anyone who's interested in it.  You don't have to have any particular cultural, political, or religious background to come to the conclusion that hurting animals is wrong. or wanting to do something about it (or supporting someone in your life who does feel that way).  Welcome! 

&gt; some dialogue with someone of the same experience that people of very different beliefs can be happy?

Every relationship is different, but lasting ones seem to be built upon a few pretty universal things (you've probably already heard of): patience, compromise, open and ongoing communication, etc.  

If you want to understand how you can support her, that to some extent requires understanding her viewpoint and where it is coming from.  

No one should be expected to be a mind reader of course, but 

&gt; my wife, who has always been a proponent of what she thought was ethical farming has decided she doesnt think that exists.

in order to understand what your wife is thinking or why she might be making this change, you may have to look into the same topics (factory farming, welfarism, animal individuality, etc) to know where she's coming from.  

&gt; Out of the blue

Internal changes and experiences aren't always outwardly obvious- at least, they rarely *begin* that way.  It's pretty rare that someone completely changes overnight; oftentimes there are many pieces of information or experience that build up over time before we are able to put them together (that's how learning works).  You might not understand where she's coming from right now (or won't necessarily agree with her through seeing only one or two things. coming from us, or from her), because she may have had many little things that contributed to and built up to this decision.  What you're seeing is more of a ""conclusion"" for her, even if it seems like a beginning for you.  

Don't just ask her to explain herself in one conversation or one night (and for your part, you can also ask her not to expect you to see things the way she does after just one conversation or piece of presented information, because you're two different people who haven't necessarily thought or seen the exact same things, and that what you want instead is an ongoing conversation about it).  Instead, ask her for a couple small pieces of information or thoughts she has had that led her to thinking this way.  And she keeps saying things you've not heard of before, repeat that process every so often.  

&gt; If that isn't available I'd love some advice on how to make her altruistic choice easier, vegan recipes, websites anything.  

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/b974w6/good_resources_for_vegan_recipes/ek2qi1z/) are some extremely simple things to start with, although there's tons of fancy and gourmet vegan food out there too.  

Not everything has to be home cooked either: there's vegan convenience food, [sit down](https://www.happycow.net/) restaurants (these can give you an idea of how interesting vegan food can be), and even junk food.    

Finally, if there's some advice I'd give, it would be to: see this as an exciting opportunity to explore something new and different.  If you two only take things out of your lives, it's going to seem restrictive, boring, or even depressing.  Instead, you should realize that there is an enormous world of vegan food, fashion, personal care items, entertainment, etc., out there to try.  If you look at this as an opportunity to explore things with her, that can make it feel very different.  

And look on the bright side: now you have gift ideas for all her upcoming holidays and birthdays.  If you just make sure it's vegan, you'll automatically get some big points with her.

I identify as vegan and feminist. If you polled Americans, I bet you some 98%+ would say that feminism is a movement about women. Not about all female animals. About women. 

To say you can't be a feminist if not a vegan is mixing the two movements in ways that don't make sense for most people. 

Remember: Most people don't think non-human animals have any rights at all. They don't believe they have moral worth. If all non-human animals have 0 moral worth, than that applies to both male and female non-human animals.

The ""You can't be feminist if you aren't vegan"" is a poor take that discredits veganism to non-vegans. I understand the notion you are trying to put forth but we are incredibly far away from that being a discussion. It will be interpreted as someone inserting veganism into an area where it doesn't really belong.

(Yes, it might belong there eventually.)

That being said, they can be grown at extremely high yields per sq meter of land I believe at higher than ratio of protein/sq meter than most plant agriculture. They also require extremely little water, less than most plants. Lastly, and this is key when looking at the big picture, they eat trash. As opposed to other animal agriculture which requires a lot of plant agriculture to sustain it, most insects do not. Feeding them compost or other 'food' that would otherwise have little to no use (I know compost does, have a use but I think the point is clear) makes it sustainable, if not pushing it towards carbon neutral.

Lastly, in society in general, and specifically the scientific and agriculture sectors, insects suffering is not seen as a moral issue at all. There is a large percentage of entomologists that claim insects don't even feel pain. So any moral objections vegans may have to farming and killing them holds almost no water, to most. Think of how hard it is to convince people mammals deserve compassion, and multiply it by a million.

I believe that plant based diets can sustain or planet, but a lot of the conventional arguments for veganism are harder to apply here.

vegan,700,"Alright, to anyone who is reading this and may be curious about veganism or unsure of what it is, heres a real simple explanation;

Veganism is a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty, whether for food, clothing or any other purpose.

And no, it is not a perfect lifestyle that is 100% void of animal deaths.

Some animals may still die indirectly, but that is the footprint of all humans. Vegans still need to eat and survive, and unfortunately some animals/insects will die due to the human footprint. Sometimes it's unavoidable. If we could change that we would.

While diet is largely a part of veganism, veganism is not just about food, e.g. it encompasses opposing animal vivisection and animal exploitation such as animal circuses and animal imprisonment, and other uses of animals as slaves or objects.

Basically, if an act encompasses exploiting, enslaving, abusing or slaughtering animals then it is opposed and is encompassed within veganism.

If there's a practicable alternative that doesn't involve the above, we will choose that option instead.

If we don't need to exploit and slaughter animals to survive, such as not eating a cow and eating a myriad of plant foods instead - we choose that option.

We show the same respect to cows, lambs, pigs and other wildlife that we would a dog or cat. They all deserve respect. They all want to survive and we don't need to exploit or bring them harm.

This does not mean that we wouldn't defend ourselves against an animal that were to threaten  us harm. Of course, that would be illogical.

""If we could live happy and healthy lives without harming others, why wouldn't we choose that option?"" That's all it is. Respect and kindness to animals who share this planet with us.

Fortunately, from a diet perspective humans will benefit hugely from plant foods, which is awesome because that is in alignment with Veganism. It's a win-win. :)

&gt; Livestock accounts for an estimated 9% of global carbon dioxide emissions, 35-40% of global methane emissions, and 65% of nitrous oxide emissions. ^[[source]](http://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e00.htm)
 
&gt; **Livestock animals emissions makeup anywhere between 14.5-18% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Comparably, the transportation sector (all cars, trucks, boats, ships and airplanes combined) is responsible for around 14% of emissions.**
  
&gt; **Methane gas is one of the largest contributors to global warming and can trap up to 100 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a five-year period.** All of this gas then enters our atmosphere. ^[[source]](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/)

&gt; **90% of rainforest deforestation is due to animal agriculture.**   

So every time we buy a beef burger or something with pork from the supermarket or a fast food like Wendy's, McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, Burger King and others, we contribuite to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and to the planet destruction your and my children will probably can't enjoy like we did.

**Other Environmental Damage Caused by Animal Agriculture:**

* habitat loss
* biodiversity loss
* ecosystem damage &amp; destruction
* growth of pathogenic organisms
* rangeland degradation
* topsoil erosion
* global warming
* formation of noxious oxide
* ammonia emissions
* wildlife killed by gov and farm operators
* spreading of nitrates in groundwater
* crop contamination
* groundwater contamination
* release of methane

---

And no, this is not the fault of government, 100 companies or the richest people in the world. 

This is our fault as consumers for paying for animal products. Supply and demand.

Like concerned parents, DH and I quickly went to Instagram to find remedies. It was on Instagram that we came across Spirit Naturals, a homeopathic medicine company based out of Boulder, Colorado.

Spirit Naturals produces many homeopathic remedies for children and they also sell many other health items every family needs: crystals, essential oils, Mongolian medicine spoons, and our favourite--- TootToot Tummies for kids!

[Ingredients]

For the ""crab"":
~0.67 lbs Laetiporus cincinnatus mushroom, hand shredded
~1.5 nori sheets
~5 strands saffron
~1 tbsp sugar
~1 tbsp salt
~1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning

The rest of the ""crab"" cake ingredients:
~1 cup panko bread crumbs
~0.5 cup vegan mayo
~1 cup red pepper, small dice
~1 cup scallion, chopped
~0.5 cup cilantro, chopped
~1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning
~1 tbsp dried thyme leaves
~1 Tsp salt
~1 Tsp cracked black pepper
~1 Tsp cayenne pepper

For the light batter for the outside of the cakes:
~0.33 cup corn starch
~0.33 cup self rising flour
~add small increments of water until it forms a thin batter

[Directions]

Bring the water, saffron, nori/seaweed/kelp, Old Bay, salt and sugar to a boil, remove from heat, strain and keep all liquid.
Boil the Laetiporus cincinnatus in the reserved liquid for at least 7 minutes. Strain, and chill in the fridge.

Once chilled, add the ""crab"" and all of the other ingredients (except the batter) to a bowl, and mix. Let the ""crab"" cake mixture sit covered in the fridge for at least an hour (for best results, do this the day before cooking them).

Once the mixture has sat in the fridge for at least an hour, form into cakes. I used a 0.25 cup measuring cup to portion out cakes for forming. Once all of the cakes are portioned (should be between 8 and 10 cakes, I made 9), get your vegetable oil to 350 F, dip your cakes in your batter, and fry until golden brown on each side.",0

&gt;I didn’t want to see it because for 21 years I created a demand for this. I paid someone to put her and her babies and her friends and family through hell, then killed. I didn’t want to watch their throats slit because I use to do that. With their blood on my hands; Being vegan is the least I can do.

&gt; The least I can do is be vegan. The least I can do it say something. The least I can do is make a post about her. So that her life won’t be for nothing. She has taught me so much just from her eyes. Maybe her death won’t be in vain. Maybe this picture of her will plant a few seeds in people.

vegan,138,"I can speak to this dissonance. I have it, kinda. 

I understand full well that I could never kill an animal. I tried once a few years ago when I went fishing with some friends. I caught a fish. It thrashed around for a while then died staring up at me, its little mouth working as if it was gasping for breath. I placed its body back in the water and announced that I wouldn't be eating any fish that night.

And yet, when I have someone else do this dirty work for me and the meat is presented to me totally disconnected from the animal it once was (and the wage slaves who killed it) in nice neat packaging, I'm fine with it. Why? I *know* what happens in industrialized animal agriculture and I think it is unconscionable and disgusting. Furthermore I am well aware of the environmental and human impacts. Yet I continue to consume. 

I am considering going vegan or at least greatly reducing my animal consumption. I just don't know how to start and never quite feel satisfied when I cook vegan at home (I'm literally typing this over some vegan vegetable curry I made a few days ago, alongside some chicken I got yesterday because the vegan food left me feeling still hungry). Probably just habit idk, also I need like 3000 calories a day just to maintain my weight so that's an issue when I'd need to eat like a bazillion pounds of food every day to meet my goals.

vegan,423,"Disclaimer: My massive weight loss wasn’t directly attributed to veganism.  But I attribute veganism to the fact that I havent gotten back to being severely obese or diabetic again.  I had diabetes almost requiring the use of insulin. I was taking medication for diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and I was only 29 when I had to begin consulting a nephrologist because it appeared I may have had the beginnings of kidney disease. 

A year after the weight loss, I started seeing my weight progressively getting higher, and my blood sugar and blood pressure starting going back up as well.  Going vegan helped me bring those numbers back down and will help me keep them down for the rest of my life.  I want to make sure I’ll be able to see my kids grow up.  Going vegan is the best insurance policy I could give myself.

EDIT: My blood sugar is actually typically in the low 90s.  This was the only picture I found though. I don’t have my glucometer anymore. Gave it and my diabetic supplies to someone else who needed it more.

EDIT2:  Failed to mention one more thing - I have had all my prescriptions discontinued. EVERYTHING is considered “resolved” (diabetes, hypertension, hyoercholesterolemia, poor kidney function, and sleep apnea all resolved.  Also since going vegan and dairy-free, my eczema and psoriasis has dramatically improved.  My eczema used to be so bad I’d attempt to wear foundation to hide the stark redness).

EDIT3:  Can’t believe how fast this post got. Thank you to everyone!!! If a moderator sees this, can I get a “vegan nurse” title?

EDIT4:  Clarification - my diet wasn’t STRICTLY meat before. Word choice was poor. But it was definitely little to zero vegetables. And very little fruit. Hated vegetables and avoided them as much as I could. I’m still learning to enjoy some of them but my intake is definitely 20-30x more fruits and vegetables than what I took in before. I previously was, as my wife described it, a garbage disposal.  I just ate everything in site that wasn’t fruits or vegetables.  After I lost the weight from a gastric sleeve bariatric surgery and saw everything I had worked for creeping back up again (high BP, FSBS going up, WEIGHT was going back up fast) I knew I had to do something. I was tired of doing the same thing over and over again - yo-yo dieting.  I’ve done the low carb thing (for a long time actually since I was diabetic, I ALWAYS felt deprived).  I’ve done juicing. I’ve done weight watchers.  I decided to just try a vegan diet. Just one day, cold turkey, I stopped eating meat, dairy, and eggs.  Told myself “I’ll just do this for 7 days”.  Well, 7 days past and I never stopped.  I just felt better and I kept going.  Weight stabilized and went back down. Blood pressure went back to normal. FSBS went back to normal. Skin cleared up way more times than it did before. Energy felt more stable.  It’s this way of living for everyone? I don’t know. I just know it works for me.   I kept going, learned more about CAFOs and the environmental impact of the industry.  Those other reasons are now whether tethers me to continue this.  I don’t know what I’ll be doing a year or so from now but at this point I CANNOT even picture myself going back to eating meat - this guy, the one who BBQ’d like crazy, the one who would watch family kill a pig to cook LECHON, the guy who was way more excited than he should have been for the DOUBLE-DOWN chicken sandwich from KFC, the guy whose favorite oil to cook with was bacon oil.  Something had to change and I made my change.  If someone, ANYONE, may be experience what I experience whether bariatric pre-op or post-op, I felt it was worth sharing.  Surgery was just a way for me to start from the beginning again.  

It doesn’t matter if you can reset the game, you can still screw up a game save if you keep making the same wrong decisions.  I just decided to make different ones. Now I’m further along in the game than I ever been.

vegan,296,"I posted this in all those threads today (surprisingly with a somewhat positive response):

Jonathan Safran Foer on PETA from Eating Animals:

&gt;Whatever one thinks of them, no organization strikes fear in the factory farm industry and its allies more than PETA. They are effective. When PETA targeted fast-food companies, the most famous and powerful welfare scientist in the country, Temple Grandin (who has designed more than half the cattle slaughter facilities in the nation), said she saw more improvement in welfare in one year than she had seen in her entire thirty-year career previously. Arguably the biggest PETA hater on the planet, Steve Kopperud (a meat industry consultant who has given anti-PETA seminars for a decade), puts it this way: “There’s enough understanding in the industry now of what PETA’s capable of to put the fear of God into many executives.” It didn’t surprise me to learn that companies of all kinds regularly negotiate with PETA and quietly make changes in their animal welfare policies to avoid being publicly targeted by the group.

That said, some studies have found that most supermarket eggs labeled “free-range” are actually layed by caged chickens; an egg farm with two caged sheds and one not can market *all* its eggs as “free-range.”

It’s all a sick marketing game. The truth is in what they leave out.

[Ingredients]

For the ""crab"":
~0.67 lbs Laetiporus cincinnatus mushroom, hand shredded
~1.5 nori sheets
~5 strands saffron
~1 tbsp sugar
~1 tbsp salt
~1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning

The rest of the ""crab"" cake ingredients:
~1 cup panko bread crumbs
~0.5 cup vegan mayo
~1 cup red pepper, small dice
~1 cup scallion, chopped
~0.5 cup cilantro, chopped
~1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning
~1 tbsp dried thyme leaves
~1 Tsp salt
~1 Tsp cracked black pepper
~1 Tsp cayenne pepper

For the light batter for the outside of the cakes:
~0.33 cup corn starch
~0.33 cup self rising flour
~add small increments of water until it forms a thin batter

[Directions]

Bring the water, saffron, nori/seaweed/kelp, Old Bay, salt and sugar to a boil, remove from heat, strain and keep all liquid.
Boil the Laetiporus cincinnatus in the reserved liquid for at least 7 minutes. Strain, and chill in the fridge.

Once chilled, add the ""crab"" and all of the other ingredients (except the batter) to a bowl, and mix. Let the ""crab"" cake mixture sit covered in the fridge for at least an hour (for best results, do this the day before cooking them).

Once the mixture has sat in the fridge for at least an hour, form into cakes. I used a 0.25 cup measuring cup to portion out cakes for forming. Once all of the cakes are portioned (should be between 8 and 10 cakes, I made 9), get your vegetable oil to 350 F, dip your cakes in your batter, and fry until golden brown on each side.",0

I had already been vegan for over a year when somehow it finally clicked just how messed up the entire industry is, and a lot of that was thanks to a [calf named Remi](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuPH7uxj0av/?igshid=1wrb8ej2vumxa).

Remi was born on a standard dairy farm, and as a standard (female) dairy calf, she was removed from her mother shortly after birth. She was going to be raised to also become a dairy cow, but because of her limited eyesight the farmers decided it would be too much work and were compassionate enough to take her to a sanctuary, Poplar Springs, instead of killing her there or selling her for meat (to be honest, I’m not sure if there’s a market for 3-month old calf meat who was originally being raised for milk).

So while Remi’s live was spared, she has no mother. Her vision is limited and she’s being forced to learn how to exist in a new world all on her own. And the reason she is alone and has no mother isn't because her mother died, or is sick, or for some other reason isn't capable of caring for her, it's because her mother is still on the dairy farm, being milked. 

Remi is alone in this world without any of the milk meant for her because we, grown adult humans, have decided it’s more important for us to have Remi’s milk than for Remi to have her mom.

Remi’s mom is literally actively being milked today. Anyone who has milk or dairy in their kitchen right now could quite possibly have milk that was supposed to go to Remi, especially anyone in the mid-Atlantic area of the US. So if that’s you, go look at Remi and tell her you have no regrets, because you’re more important than she is.

And if that idea bothers you at all, check out some of the dairy free options right next to the dairy options the next time you’re at the store.",0

vegan,143,"While I agree it is not the end goal, it certainly helps you get there. 

Veganism requires you to value the basic rights of others over your own egoistic interest.

When taking into account that much of western culture, specifically American culture, is built on a neoliberal foundation which literally preaches individual gain and freedom over anything else, it becomes apparent that not everyone shares this more selfless attitude. 

In this sense, I think veganism does indeed make you a better person as it requires you to be able to consider the welfare of the planet and all of its beings over your own comfort. This attitude can then be applied to almost any other situation and provide a more compassionate outlook and response.

vegan,1,"u/YourVeganFallacyIs was the technical and operations core of r/vegan. I've known of their enthusiastic vegan advocacy here on r/vegan for years even before I started actively posting here. Their dedication to veganism and to the quality of the community is plainly evidenced by their history and by the messages of support they have received from this post. 

&amp;nbsp;

Their appointment as moderator over a year ago along with u/DreamTeamVegan helped guide [r/vegan through 2018 to where it is now, doubling the subscriber count](https://subredditstats.com/r/vegan). For most of 2018, only 2 active moderators, YVFI and DTV, handled the management and operations of the subreddit. They were left on their own by the inactive 'old' moderators, alone to implement technical solutions and resources for communication, change management, automation, documentation and operations. I heard they also occasionally slept and ate.

&amp;nbsp;

As the subreddit grew, additional moderators u/AllieLikesReddit and u/CharlieAndArtemis joined and by this time backend policies and training had been developed and implemented to help new moderators get up to speed with efficient unified moderation practices. The documentation and training was handled almost exclusively by u/YourVeganFallacyIs. Training extended to hour long video conferencing and screen sharing where every click and keystroke was explicitly defined and explained to help every moderator perform with aptitude and efficiency.

&amp;nbsp;

When I started participating in auxiliary team duties at the start of this year, it took me 2 weeks to read back the volume of moderator policy discussion from the previous year. To the general subscriber or visitor here, you have no idea how many hundreds of hours of internal debate and discussion went into every little change or potential change. Everything was reasoned rationally. Everything was documented. Everything was evaluated for impact and risk. All decisions and changes were done so by the active team members together - no one single person held power. Every team member was invited to participate. But if team members don't show up, don't reply to mail, don't engage in active moderation at all, there simply is no choice but to get on with the job of managing the subreddit without them. That's the reality of running a busy public facing endeavour like this subreddit. 

&amp;nbsp;

Every active moderator was either on duty or on call perhaps 10 - 12 hours a day for every single day of the week striving to provide round the clock coverage to the subreddit community. The level of personal dedication and sacrifice by the active moderation team was astonishing because from the outside, noone would have a clue. It was not an ego trip, it was a love and a duty to help in some small way a vegan community and by extension, veganism.

&amp;nbsp;

The active moderator majority had been functioning brilliantly for months with a level of professionalism you would expect more from a company than a group of volunteers teleconferencing from all over the world. If you were a moderator, you were expected to show up each day for 'work' for whatever period you can spare in service of this community. If you were absent, you were expected to communicate that unavailability to the team so that your shift could be covered so as to not impact the quality of service the public subreddit users enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;

So what's gone wrong? 

Why are we here telling you this? 

Reddit moderator hierarchy is an authoritarian system dictated by seniority rather than merit or democracy. Top moderator holds absolute power. Power to dismiss all other moderators below unquestioned or opposed. A rush of blood to the head from a brand new inexperienced 'leader' thrust into power unexpectedly resulted in the unannounced, unsupported, unilateral dismissal of arguably the most technically vital and experienced team member. A 'leader' with no respect, knowledge or understanding of general change management practice, let alone the very detailed and specific change management in place and worked for by the active moderation team. Further personal sentiment of the disastrous consequences of this persons actions cannot be expressed professionally but you can imagine if the majority of your active working team walk out on the new boss, there is a reason.

&amp;nbsp;

But fear not. There are still active moderators and there will no doubt be new active moderators. Veganism grows stronger and the subreddit will continue to grow. All this is minor transient fluff in the grand scheme of life.

Me : single. 

I was buying some groceries this week. And noticed a woman searching the vegan options for a couple of products. 

And yes I thought I found another vegan. 

She was good looking. So me wondering should I ,  should I try and make a connection. Starting of course with something about veganism. 

Finally decided I have nothing to loose. 

Approached. Saw her cart and products and saw.. greek yoghurt.

I'll never forget a couple of years ago when my aunt/uncle visited for spring break and they wanted to go out to dinner one night with my parents, my siblings, and myself. Sometimes, my family wrongly assumes that since I'm vegan, I only want to go to vegan restaurants even though that is not true at all. I'm completely happy with going to any restaurant as most places have a veg menu or will create something for you if you ask kindly, which has always worked out fine for me. Well my parents suggested Mellow Mushroom and my aunt/uncle went along with it. They're from an area that didn't have Mellow Mushroom at the time so they had no real idea what to expect. Luckily everything went well and my uncle told me after dinner that he secretly was sweating bullets before dinner because he assumed Mellow Mushroom was going to be some hippy vegan salad place.

vegan,159,"tl;dr: I don't hunt or eat meat, but OP is straw manning hunters. Vegans don't like constantly dealing with poorly-reasoned objections, so the least that can be done is not doing the same to others.

&gt; Humans and the livestock we raise make up 96% of mammal biomass on earth \[[Source](https://www.ecowatch.com/biomass-humans-animals-2571413930.html)\]. Wild mammals make up 4%. There is no sustainable way to bring meat to the table to 8 billion people without factory farming, which is itself massively unsustainable in a multitude of other ways. If the world hunted for their food, we would have no wild mammals left in a matter of months. Hunting is ""sustainable"" because so few people actually hunt for their meat.

I've never seen a hunter claim everyone could or should move to eating hunted meat, so this is a straw man. The individuals who do eat what they shoot can offset their factory-farmed meats, and as the wild animals are a net gain for the environment, their marginal contribution to the degradation of the planet is smaller than someone who eats just as much meat from factory farming + plastic packaging.

You could make the same argument for a ton of vegan foods that would be tough if everyone consumed them or tried to scale, but are still *better* as-is. Looking at you, water-greedy almond milk, meat substitutes, and low-scale organic farming (nice veggies can be crazy expensive).

&gt; If they cared about forest and wildlife management, hunters would donate this money instead or be in favor of raising taxes to fund those organizations. Hunters just want to hunt. I can think of no more a hypocritical way to ""enjoy and preserve the outdoors"" than enacting my violence upon it for no other good reason than ""I like to hunt."" Most hunters live within a stone's throw of a grocery store.

If vegans cared about animals and the environment, they'd never, ever use any plastic, right?

It's possible to be 1) imperfect but better and 2) do two things. Tons of hunters *are also hikers*, go backpacking, buy park passes, etc. A ton of them are also environmentalists. In fact, they can be the primary environmentalist contingent in rural (and generally conservative) states/provinces.

And your premise is still false: if parks get hunters' money, they get hunters' money, even if it doesn't pass your purity test.

&gt; This is correct to a degree. Natural predators do this much better than we can ever hope to achieve. Pest populations can often become out of control in suburban areas. This has become a frequent issue in areas of the southeast United States for no other reason than we eliminated their natural predators. Take Yellowstone National Park for example: when wolves were reintroduced to the park after being hunted out, it brought an ecological balance and solved issues that had plagued the park for decades \[[Source](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140128-how-wolves-saved-a-famous-park)\]. 

Yellowstone didn't allow hunters in the areas affected, so you're comparing apples to oranges.

It's not like hunters are just making up wild animals suffering in the winter / becoming overpopulated. Even if one were to grant that other predators are more effective ecologically, it won't change the fact that in prime hunting areas, the same population of deer will face these deaths: seconds to minutes via bullet, minutes to hours via bows or predators (this is why bow hunting is straight-up unethical, full stop), hours to days to weeks starving and freezing in the winter. The environment has a carrying capacity and deer aren't exactly planning their procreation habits based on it.

I think OP might be trying to make understated points that assume a claim that hunting is necessary and there are no alternatives, but I've yet to see hunters make that claim, either.

&gt; The primary reason for eliminating these natural predators is to protect our livestock. Rabbit populations plague farmers when predators like foxes and weasels are hunted out of the area to protect chickens and other fowl. Animal agriculture has caused this ""need"" for humans to perform population control through hunting, and everything about the cycle is a result of us enforcing our human will on the natural world in the first place.

This is a good point - predators (et al) get shot by ranchers and other folks that maintain livestock and if we stopped raising livestock the predators might (might) recover. I'm not sure why this is hunters' problem in particular, as they are, again, offsetting their consumption of livestock.

&gt; Then I have an awesome new hobby for you hunters: **wildlife photography**. It captures the same essence of hunting, minus the violence. You get a ""trophy"" in the form of pictures you take. It requires patience and extended time spent in a natural setting. As far as I know, there are no restrictions on taking photos of any species at any time of the year, unlike hunting. Photographing a deer well is going to be much more of a challenge than shooting it.

They are not the same. Someone who enjoys hunting won't be wowed by this argument at all, and again, hunters are already outdoorsy.

&gt; There is no reason to hunt as a non-indigenous human who takes advantage of all the luxuries of the 1st world.

There are thousands of deer dying slowly and painfully every winter and your dad wants to spend some time bonding and the way he did that with his dad is hunting. You go and provide a comparatively humane death to an animal who lived a much better life than a factory-farmed animal. 

Seems like a better deal than, ""let them die slowly and painfully so I can feel righteous in all ways"".",0

So that's for that. As for honey, I'm gonna attack this beekeeper's arguments point by point.

-	“Harvesting honey does not hurt bees.”

Response: “When farmers remove honey from a hive, they replace it with a sugar substitute which is significantly worse for the bees’ health since it lacks the essential micro-nutrients of honey.” Source: https://www.naturalbeekeepingtrust.org/bee-centred-vs-conventional

Also, in conventional beekeeping, honey bees are specifically bred to increase productivity. Already endangered, this selective breeding narrows the population gene pool and increases susceptibility to disease and large-scale die-offs. Diseases are also caused by importing different species of bees for use in hives. Source: https://friendsoftheearth.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/beesreport.pdf

Because of farmed bees growing so much in population, native bumble bees decline. Source: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6037932_Decline_and_Conservation_of_Bumble_Bees

In addition, hives can be culled post-harvest to keep farmer costs down. Queen bees often have their wings clipped by beekeepers to prevent them leaving the hive to produce a new colony elsewhere, which would decrease productivity and lessen profit.

This isn’t even to mention that in commercial practice, it’s cheaper to cull the colony when winter comes and order new bees than to care for them over the winter.

As for the bees themselves, managed honeybees do pollinate plants but are not helpful to the environment because they crowd out and bring disease to native keystone pollinators.

Honey is probably the least important of any of the animal products to worry about, but it’s’unnecessary. And if agave was a problem? We’d avoid that shit, too. Neither are needed in life.

As for hardcore - go and bear witness. Look the victims in the eyes and then stand there helpless as they’re driven through the gates. If they’re pigs, you’ll likely have to stand the screams from the gas chamber as you’re waiting for the next truck. Deal with all the pain that brings to give love to the victims and then tell me they’re not hardcore.

vegan,51,"Yes, of course humans are animals, and that basically gets to the crux of one of the main reasons veganism exists, to counter carnism. 

Carnism is the fallacy that the majority of humans believe in, that only a specific (almost arbitrary) subset of animal species deserve to live and be protected from suffering.  All of us universally agree that humans are afforded the right to live happy, long, fulfilling lives. And we even extend this right to certain non-human animals such as companion animals, as as most wild animals (especially exotic and endangered ones), because we do accept their sentience and ability to suffer.  But beyond that set of species, when it comes to that set of animals we for some reason like to eat, then suddenly the generally-accepted morals become forgotten/invalidated. Even when we know without question through scientific proof that all sentient animals can feel pain and actively avoid it, and that some species of animals we don't protect are even more intelligent than some of the species that we do protect.

Yes, humans are at the top of the food chain (even though we have extracted ourselves from it almost entirely) and yes we can be considered the most ""intelligent"" yet we are still animals. However thanks to our intelligence, we not only are able to recognize how we cause suffering, but also have developed the knowledge and means to be able to avoid it and still live happy, healthy lives. Some people like to call veganism elitist or self-important, but it is exactly the opposite of that. It's the realisation that we are *not* inherently more deserving of a life free from suffering, exploitation and needless death than the animals upon which we inflict suffering, exploitation and needless death. That is veganism.",0

Fyi it's very well-documented in the vegetarian community how poorly -treated slaughterhouse workers are, and what abysmal conditions they have to persevere through.  I don't really have time to provide links at the moment but I'll tell you that my personal favorite source for this info was a book called Slaughterhouse by Gail Eisnitz.

Slaughterhouse workers are often put in extremely dangerous conditions with a huge amount of exposure to unsanitary and potentially injected fluids etc and not enough enforcement on health and safety standards.  There's a very high rate of employing illegal workers so that no one can complain about it, and there are also increased trends of domestic abuse among slaughterhouse workers, presumably as a result of in internalizing/normalizing the violence they are compelled to commit every day.

I don't think your comment was downvoted because people care more about animals than about humans, as you pose.  I think it's because the person you replied to brought up a very good point about the effect of that kind of work on people, and your comment came across as callous and kind of ridiculous in that light.  Most of us work for bosses, but even our sometimes frustrating working conditions are not even comparable to working at a slaughterhouse.

So, I abstain from somethings but still contribute to suffering and pollution by participating in others (ex. I don't eat meat but I do drive a car so I do still participate in polluting the environment and animal habitats).  The best we can do is try to lead by example.  I make a point to bring delicious vegan food when I'm invited to someone's home so they can see how easy it is to reduce their own consumption of animal products by offering simple substitutes.  It also affords people the opportunity to try things that they otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to because people are naturally hesitant to try things that are unfamiliar to them.    When I become impatient with others, I make a point to start researching something in my own life and often find that there's something I could be doing differently to reduce my own harm (ex. I have a cat and recently learned of the negative environmental impact of clay based litter, so I switched to walnut shells which are a food production byproduct and now when I have visitors I can provide them with an example of how effective a clay based substitute can be with odor control).  This research can also serve as a grounding technique and remind me that there are a lot more issues and changes that need to be made in our lifestyles in order to minimize our harm.  Changing our diets is a big and important step, but it isn't the only one. ",0

We provided the ASA with a report by the Cattle Health and Welfare Group which clearly stated that in 2015, the most recent year for which data was available, 497,000 male calves were born but only 392,000 were registered. This resulted in 95,000 unregistered male calves killed on-farm. We also supplied evidence from the Farm Animal Welfare Committee which confirmed that male calves are ‘euthanised’ by shooting.

Lastly, the statistic had been confirmed in a report by The Guardian and in a BBC interview with David George of the National Farmers’ Union. The presenter asked Mr George “is it true that 95,000 calves are shot in the head every year?” to which Mr George responded “I’m afraid it is, yes”",0

vegan,52,"So, I've been eating meat my whole life (30years old) for a few reasons. Firstly, my folks grew up on farms and that's all they knew, so a normal dinner for me was the staple of meat, potatoes and a veggie. Sencondly because I thought that was what i ""needed"" (based off of nothing more than sheer ignorance). Fast forward to about 6 years ago, I met someone whom later became my wife, she became a vegan loooong before we met. So for the past length of our relationship, we would always have to separate meals, cooking two completely different meals throughout the course of each day, however on holidays our meal would always be 100% vegan. Throughout that process, I learned how to make some exceptionally delicious vegan meals. It got to the point that i would prefer the vegan options simply based off of taste alone.. then I started noticing the positive changes supplementing meat with plant based options was having on my body as a whole. From not having an upset stomach, to not feeling sluggish, just overall feeling healthy... simply from cutting out all animal products. Which now leads me to this picture and today. I am proud to say that today mark's my first two weeks of a complete plant based diet and I could not be more happier with my choice, and my overall health. 

No Evil Foods is a staple for us, damn near every meal is comprised of their products from jambalaya, pot roast, tacos, lasagna, and everything in between. 

I haven't seen alot of No Evil products posted, so I just wanted to let you all know that this company is out there. And furthermore I wanted to thank you all for the recipes and motivation to finally make me say ""I've had it"" in regards to eating meat.

A milking cow eats around 100 pounds of feed a day, that's *18 tons* a year.

Hard to translate that to feeding-a-family terms though, so let's come at it from a different angle. Given the claim in the article of one cow feeding a family for a year, and the percent I see oft-quoted about calorie efficiency for beef of 3%, and the fact that the dairy cow will live about 2.5 times as long as a typical beef cow, and eat about 4x as much (yup, you gotta feed a dairy cow a *ton* more to make all that milk, than you do a cow you're slowly fattening up over the course of a couple years)... you can save enough calories to feed that same family for roughly 330 years, if my math is right. Or 33 families 10 years. Or 330 families for an entire year, instead of feeding *one* family shitty ground beef for a year.

There are so many. All revolutions. Nazis, Communist, or how we treated blacks (and white) slaves in the past, it's abhorrent. Pure evil.

But you're right, groupthink and deference of responsibility to a different authoritative body. If anyone hasn't already done so, look up the Milgram experiment. Random participants were told of a new learning technique, to administer a shock to the trial participant when they provided an incorrect answer to a question asked, with the shock voltage increased for each failed attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

There was no real shock of course, the ""participant"" was an actor, but the study participants who were administering the technique were willing to go up to the lethal (clearly marked on the machine) voltage when told to do so by a man with a lab coat (authoritative) who told them all responsibility for any injury or death would rest with him.

&amp;#x200B;

If I recall, 80% or more of participants would administer the lethal shock. Only 20% of people walking around have an internal code strong enough that they would refuse an order from an authority figure.

vegan,53,"It is about making money in some sense. We employ people and pay better than other businesses in the area. We work to make our prices reasonable for families and locals.

Thus far I have personally made exactly $0 on this endeavor. Anyway, personally I believe a viable, inclusive business that encourages customers to consume less meat in a clear and public way is an effective strategy if the goal is to work towards realistically minimizing animal consumption. 

I think there is a distinct lack of restaurants that offer both great omni and vegan options. Most non-vegan restaurants only make token attempts at vegan food. By making some of our flagship dishes totally vegan, my goal here is to create a place where vegans who have a lot of non-vegan friends (IE every vegan I know) can eat out with their friends and not feel like second class citizens while at the same time trying to entice and convince devout meat-eaters that vegan food can be seriously delicious and consider altering their diet to some degree.

I know people who have come to my place thinking they would get a sausage (our main offering) and getting one of our vegan dishes instead. I consider that a big win. If we offered only vegan items that person would never have stepped foot in the door to begin with.

vegan,53,"The milking process itself is done by a machine which a cow is already going to be uncomfortable with. But perhaps the most stress comes from the fact that a dairy farmer puts his hand into the cow’s rectum to deposit bull semen inside her so she’ll get pregnant. 

After she’s been raped and impregnated, she’ll have to stand in a closed stall with barely any sunlight on her legs until the baby comes to term. After her child is born, it’s taken away from her in less than a day. If you watch videos of this, you can see them both crying for each other FOR DAYS after the separation. The calf is taken away because the milk (which is meant for the calf) will be used for human consumption. If the baby’s a male, they’re seen as too expensive to raise so they’re sent to slaughter to become veal or just shot in the head by a farmer. Females are raised to undergo the torturous process their mothers faced. 

The cows will be repeatedly raped, impregnated and have their calves stolen from them until the mother can’t produce enough milk. Then she’ll be killed for beef. 

It’s a disgusting, heart breaking and horrifying process. It’s done to these beautiful and innocent animals everyday.

While they did stop donating to outright political anti-marriage groups in 2012, they continue to donate to groups like fellowship of Christian athletes which in its mission statement is still in support of marriage as one man one woman, and makes its members sign a pledge including the agreement not to be gay.

While Christianity might not be inherently homophobic, many of its practitioners believe its suppose to be and so treat the lgbt community with a huge lack of dignity.

Thus far I have personally made exactly $0 on this endeavor. Anyway, personally I believe a viable, inclusive business that encourages customers to consume less meat in a clear and public way is an effective strategy if the goal is to work towards realistically minimizing animal consumption. 

I think there is a distinct lack of restaurants that offer both great omni and vegan options. Most non-vegan restaurants only make token attempts at vegan food. By making some of our flagship dishes totally vegan, my goal here is to create a place where vegans who have a lot of non-vegan friends (IE every vegan I know) can eat out with their friends and not feel like second class citizens while at the same time trying to entice and convince devout meat-eaters that vegan food can be seriously delicious and consider altering their diet to some degree.

I know people who have come to my place thinking they would get a sausage (our main offering) and getting one of our vegan dishes instead. I consider that a big win. If we offered only vegan items that person would never have stepped foot in the door to begin with.

vegan,53,"No, and I'm going to explain why.

Veganism is a moral philosophy. While there is plenty of room for disagreement within this moral philosophy, there is no way to only sort of be philosophically (aka ethically) vegan. You are either against animals being exploited or you are not. There may be disagreements on what exactly is and isn't exploitation, but in order to be vegan - which is what this sub is about - you must be unequivocally against exploitation.

This sub is not about your diet. It's not about trying to be better. It's about fighting exploitation. The overlap between diet &amp; self-improvement and fighting exploitation is little more than coincidence. They are not the foundations of the philosophy.

""Slowly makes more ethical choices"" isn't a thing. If you understand that they are more ethical choices, then you should be making them, and if you're not ready to be making them for whatever reason, fine, but this place is absolutely not a place that should be providing any encouragement, any measure of acceptance, to forever embracing animal exploitation. 

If they are making these choices for reasons that have nothing to do with ethics, that doesn't help the actual mission of veganism - fighting the mentality that is ok with animals being exploited. Animal agriculture is a symptom of the problem of people being willing to exploit animals. So while reducing consumption is an improvement of a symptom of the problem, it is not an improvement on the actual problem.

And if they *are* making these choices for ethical reasons, then we should not be pretending that it's ok for them to continue with actions they themselves agree are unethical. We can be understanding of the process, but this post isn't being understanding of the process; it is being welcoming of shunning the process entirely. This post is explicitly saying ""It's ok if you forever think it's fine to exploit animals"" and that goes *literally, directly* against veganism.

If you believe mentalities like this should have a platform, make a new sub. But supporting this message in r/vegan is like supporting dog fighting in an anti-dog abuse sub or supporting large government in an anarchist sub. It is fundamentally at odds with the mission of the philosophy this place is supposed to be founded on.",0

vegan,54,"When I still ate meat, I hated the comparison of dog meat markets to what's done in the west. My justification was that dogs were bred for thousands of years to be companion animals, whereas farm animals were bred to be consumed. So a dog expects kindness and companionship, only to be essentially abused and possibly skinned alive before being consumed.

It's obviously a completely illogical way to look at the situation. Maybe a pig doesn't want to be your friend and make you part of his ""pack"" (or whatever groups of pigs are called) like a dog might, but he is smarter than the dog and probably wouldn't *mind* being your pal if you let him. They want to be treated kindly, as all creatures do. They certainly don't want to die.

But I bring up my point about how I previously saw the situation as an example of how omnivores see the issue. Those ""why love one but eat the other"" billboards only work on people who are already susceptible to that kind of thinking. It may be speciesism, but your average person doesn't give a single shit if you call them speciesist.

Those billboards do work on people who are ready for the message, though, and I think those people are those who find out how wonderful, smart and interesting farm animals actually are.

vegan,54,"I will add that this story has a marginally happy ending in that Poplar Springs took in a pregnant cow named Maple just after getting Remi, and Remi has now bonded closely with Maple and her son Grayson.

Maple was going to be slaughtered while 9 months pregnant with Grayson (a standard industry practice, there are even guidelines for how to handle slaughtering pregnant cows), but was saved by a compassionate neighbor who convinced her owners to let her live at the sanctuary instead.

But it’s still clear that while Grayson has his mom, Remi doesn’t, and while her adopted family is so adorable and wonderful, it’s not how it’s supposed to be. Remi still eats grass while Grayson nurses, and Maple still checks on Grayson before Remi. Remi’s independence compared to Grayson is obvious. She’ll never get to know what Grayson knows - a life with her mom who cares for her and protects her and chooses her first.

Edit: A few more posts with Remi, Grayson, and Maple...

I also use it in a lot of my homemade house cleaners because vinegar smells terrible and the essential oils mask the smell super well.  I like making homemade cleaners because it saves me a decent amount of money, so it all works out better this way.

Not a stupid question at all - it's a stupid, cruel system. 

Yes, a sow will live most of her life in these crates. Sows are moved back and forth between gestation crates and farrowing crates until they are killed.

&gt; Since the 1970s, gestation crates have been standard housing in most hog-breeding facilities nationwide. For the nearly four-month duration of her pregnancy, each sow lives, eats, and sleeps in a roughly two-and-half-by-seven-foot stall that does not allow her to walk, turn around, or socialize. After giving birth and living in a slightly larger farrowing crate for a month, she is impregnated again and returned to the stall. The cycle is repeated for three to four years until her production drops off, and she is slaughtered for breakfast sausage.

""Carnosine is an important nutrient that is gaining greater attention, due to dozens of research studies that have demonstrated its wide range of health benefits. There's just one caveat: carnosine is only found as carnosine in fish, beef, poultry and pork. And yet, ironically, the animals that are considered the best sources of this nutrient do not themselves consume animals. So, where are they getting their carnosine from? The same place that vegans are getting theirs: whole foods.
Carnosine, which is concentrated in the brain and muscle tissues, is a dipeptide of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine. And while carnosine, in its whole dipeptide form, is only found in meat, both of its constituents are found in a wide variety of plant foods. This is the most logical explanation for how animals like cows, turkeys, chickens and pigs come to have so much in their tissues, especially when one considers how carnosine in meat is broken down and used in the body.""

The woman who cooked the pizza placed ham beneath the cheese and it was not noticed by anyone and when Gordon realized it he told the vegetarian dude (the eating, and the judging, were filmed at separate times and in between he clearly found out) and although he clearly didn't care and was laughing he didn't purposely force a vegetarian to eat meat. When the veg dude says, ""That was mean"" Gordon says over and over, no no I didn't know!

If you watch any of his shows even from back then he goes off on chefs multiple times if they make a vegetarian dish non-veg because it's an allergy/liability issue.

No farm animal is slaughtered when it's ""all grown up"". Ever. This is not profitable or economically viable.

Dairy cows 4-5 years of age (they can live 20-30 years), veal cows usually 6 months at the maximum, chickens only after a few months, etc.

So I posed the question: ""Well, the only reason we're in this situation is because we *only just found out about it*. How long has this been going on? What if its happening at other areas? It happened at one, so it can definitely happen again.""

Them: ""... ""

Me: ""Yeno what you could always try instead? Try a milk thats *guaranteed* to never cause any harm or pain or suffering. Try something like Oat milk or Almond. Is it exactly the same? No, but! You never have to worry about supporting something like that ever again.""

Them: ""... well... does it taste good? What about calcium and vitamin D?""

Me: ""It tastes great! And its fortified to have more of those then normal milk actually. Give it a try, see if you like it - and if not, try another brand! And if you do, then you don't have to ever feel like you're supporting animal cruelty.""

vegan,56,"Ok, but most of the fish in our grocery stores were caught with massive nets, several square miles in area, being dragged behind big ships through miles of ocean, collecting any and all marine life in their path. This method of fishing kills completely indiscriminately; the fish we traditionally eat, like the salmon and the tuna, are bundled up right alongside the animals we don't eat, both fish and others like dolphins.

Every year, an estimated 2.8 trillion fish are killed in this way. 2.8 trillion. To put that into perspective, only a little over 100 billion --or 0.1 trillion-- humans have ever existed throughout our existence as a species. The entire history of human beings is nothing more than a rounding error compared to the number of fish killed *in a single year!* I value all sentient beings' rights to life and bodily autonomy equally, but even if you only granted each fish one thousandth of the worth of a human life, commercial fishing would still be a huge injustice. (**EDIT** On second thought, that's still a huge understatement. Even if you only value a fish *one millionth* as much as you value a person, that's still comparable to killing almost *three million* people a year for no good reason).

And yet, people think that not using a plastic straw completely absolves them off any responsibly for the fish they pretend to care so deeply about. The truth is, the straws don't matter! Of course I'm against all unnecessary deaths of animals, but when turning down a plastic straw gives somebody the impression that they've done all they should to help the fish, when there's a much more effective option (not eating fish!)

I think the difference is that those decisions don't force us to completely reevaluate our personal ethics and cultural values. 

We grow up believing that pollution is bad, but most of us never seriously questioned the morality of our diets, which we have inherited from our culture. Grandma's brisket? Sorry, that's wrong. Once you go vegan you realize just how entrenched we are in the exploitation of animals and the shift in consciousness that occurs when you realize that so much of what we consume, from candy to our shoes, is made using animals, is pretty extreme.

Maybe because I believe the most immediate way of cultural integration is through food, and I feel both cultural integration and the spread of ""veganism"" (as a mostly rich-white concept - which is a different discussion I don't feel like getting into right now) into other cultural mindsets is desirable. 

Obviously everyone's allowed to do whatever they want - I don't mean to grill you down on it, I understand why you do it and I often do it out of simplicity. I just felt this is a good moment to interject and say: don't use the ""vegan"" label as a shorthand for not knowing what is in your food. That's what got humanity in the current shit show to begin with. 

If in doubt, ask what things are made of, instead of stating what you don't want them to be. Learn how they cook. I often go to this amazing hand pulled noodle place because I once randomly found out this ONE dish they make happens to be vegan (peanut sauce with no fish sauce or meat stock in it) and it's delicious and I'm not even sure they know I'm vegan. I just befriended the cook and saw how he made them from scratch (open plan kitchen). I feel like me ordering that and later talking to them about reducing animal based ingredients is a far better way to steer them into the right direction than just refusing to engage.

Bottom line is of course you will do whatever is necessary to make sure your baby is healthy and is on the right track for development, but a) you were lied to by an ignorant nurse/doctor about ""straight protein"" and b) all she did was ask a simple question. You were never in the wrong.

2 cases of accidental taking of pets in PETA's nearly 40 years of helping stray animals. 

In the first case, the dog was roaming with other strays, had no collar, no tag, and no leash, all while the owner was at work, so not present. The other dogs PETA took in from the scene were actual strays, and the owner of that one dog was clearly negligent. No one at PETA was prosecuted for this. 

In the second case, PETA workers found a dog wandering alone on the side of highway, a clearly dangerous situation. This dog was collared but PETA was justified in taking the animal out of that situation. The only thing they did wrong here was leave the dog's collar on the side of the road, but the judge felt there wasn't evidence they did this maliciously. Ironically, the dog's owner was an animal control officer.

Somehow, in these two scenarios, PETA faces massive backlash for taking animals out of dangerous environments, while the two negligent owners who abandoned their pets are left completely uncriticized.

Looking back it makes me sad to think how much time I wasted trying to please him instead of being true to myself and putting myself first. Please don't make the same mistake I did, your husband is being completely unreasonable and you have to do what's best for you (and your girls!).

vegan,58,"&gt;A cow does on average release between 70 and 120 kg of Methane per year. Methane is a greenhouse gas like carbon dioxide (CO2). But the negative effect on the climate of Methane is 23 times higher than the effect of CO2. Therefore the release of about 100 kg Methane per year for each cow is equivalent to about 2'300 kg CO2 per year.
Let's compare this value of 2'300 kg CO2: The same amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) is generated by burning 1'000 liters of petrol. With a car using 8 liters of petrol per 100 km, you could drive 12'500 km per year (7'800 miles per year).

&gt;World-wide, there are about 1.5 billion cows and bulls. All ruminants (animals which regurgitates food and re-chews it) on the world emit about two billion metric tons of CO2-equivalents per year. In addition, clearing of tropical forests and rain forests to get more grazing land and farm land is responsible for an extra 2.8 billion metric tons of CO2 emission per year!

&gt;According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) agriculture is responsible for 18% of the total release of greenhouse gases world-wide (this is more than the whole transportation sector). Cattle-breeding is taking a major factor for these greenhouse gas emissions according to FAO. Says Henning Steinfeld, Chief of FAO's Livestock Information and Policy Branch and senior author of the report: ""Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems. Urgent action is required to remedy the situation.""

&gt;Livestock now use 30 percent of the earth's entire land surface, mostly permanent pasture but also including 33 percent of the global arable land used to producing feed for livestock, the report notes. As forests are cleared to create new pastures, it is a major driver of deforestation, especially in Latin America where, for example, some 70 percent of former forests in the Amazon have been turned over to grazing.

&gt;These industries perpetuate the ‘humane myth’ with labels such as ‘local,’ ‘free range’, ‘grass fed’, ‘organic’, &amp; ‘cage free’ - all terms which are used to deceive and mislead the public into believing that animals are ‘humanely raised &amp; humanely killed’. We are here to show that this is not the case. We are forcing transparency in an industry that relies on secrecy.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The needless violence inflicted upon these animals needs to stop. This facility is not unique in their horrendous treatment of animals. This is a standard representation of factory farming here in Canada. This action is not about this one facility, or a call for better animal welfare standards, but rather a call to end the inherently violent animal agriculture industry entirely.",0

That above site makes the claim that our body does indeed process isoflavones but at a reduced level to our naturally produced estrogen.

Of course being vegan isn't for the sake of non-vegans. But their perception of vegans has a huge impact on the growth and future of the vegan culture/lifestyle/philosophy, whether you agree or like it or not.

Take religion as an example.
The Bible basically lays out how you're supposed to use your behavior, philosophy and general lifestyle as an example to others- if you can be happy, healthy and inclusive while also being religious (vegan), then you encourage emulation and discourse.

If you take your faith to the extreme (jihadism), or force your ideology down people's throats without actually hearing or entertaining anything outside your faith, or use your philosophy as an excuse to ostracize or victimize others (Christianity), all you do is vindicate other extreme followers, or ""preach to the choir"", so to speak.

https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/39.01

Chapter 39 section 1

&gt; 4 (f) Neglects the child. Within the context of the definition of “harm,” the term “neglects the child” means that the parent or other person responsible for the child’s welfare fails to supply the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or health care, although financially able to do so or although offered financial or other means to do so. However, a parent or legal custodian who, by reason of the legitimate practice of religious beliefs, does not provide specified medical treatment for a child may not be considered abusive or neglectful for that reason alone, but such an exception does not:

&gt; 1. Eliminate the requirement that such a case be reported to the department;

&gt; 2. Prevent the department from investigating such a case; or

&gt; 3. Preclude a court from ordering, when the health of the child requires it, the provision of medical services by a physician, as defined in this section, or treatment by a duly accredited practitioner who relies solely on spiritual means for healing in accordance with the tenets and practices of a well-recognized church or religious organization.

Also

&gt; 44 “Neglect” occurs when a child is deprived of, or is allowed to be deprived of, **necessary food**, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment or a child is permitted to live in an environment when such deprivation or environment causes the child’s physical, mental, or emotional health to be significantly impaired or to be in danger of being significantly impaired. The foregoing circumstances shall not be considered neglect if caused primarily by financial inability unless actual services for relief have been offered to and rejected by such person. A parent or legal custodian legitimately practicing religious beliefs in accordance with a recognized church or religious organization who thereby does not provide specific medical treatment for a child may not, for that reason alone, be considered a negligent parent or legal custodian; however, such an exception does not preclude a court from ordering the following services to be provided, when the health of the child so requires:

&gt; (a) Medical services from a licensed physician, dentist, optometrist, podiatric physician, or other qualified health care provider; or

&gt; (b) Treatment by a duly accredited practitioner who relies solely on spiritual means for healing in accordance with the tenets and practices of a well-recognized church or religious organization.

&gt; Neglect of a child includes acts or omissions.

While I can't see anything specifically requiring parents to cater to special dietary requirements, I believe that is implied. Certainly several Florida state government documents suggest that.

http://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/childrens-health/child-care-food-program/Nutrition/special-needs.html

https://publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/PHLC-Florida-HER-State-Summary.pdf

Inform your mother that you've read the Florida statute, done some research and it's your understanding that ""necessary food"" takes into account religion, culture and choices like veganism.

If she cares to challenge that view, tell her that you will not eat non-vegan food and one of two things will happen.

Either you will report her to the authorities for neglect or you will get sick from malnutrition, take yourself to a doctor for testing, who will then report her to the authorities for neglect.",0

vegan,59,"Repost of my comment from the kurzegesagt subreddit:

The videos argument boils down to meat has protein and fat and some vitamins that mean it not bad. Inuits tho. Completely ignoring that plant based diets decreases overall mortality (meaning people die less) and decreases the risk for over 70 % of the top leading killers in the United States of America. The only thing it mentions about this is that some scientists disagree which apparently means that it can't be correct. This completely ignores that some scientists disagree with climate change and that the studies were peer rewieved which is the gold standard when it comes to science. All the studies kurzegesagt showed in favor of meat being healthy were either funded by pro meat corporations, conducted very badly, or done by scientists with a vested interest in meat or animal product.

The inuit argument is also based on misrepresentated data as this video shows: https://nutritionfacts.org/2018/07/12/the-eskimo-myth/

The vitamin argument is also faulty as omnivores are deficient in more vitamins than vegans.

source: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2/ (1 minute and 25 seconds hopefully not too long for you) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJCHVEatqY (the same video just on youtube)

People eating a zerocarb diet like the inuit, have even more deficiencies than vegans as they have no source of fiber and vitamins such as vitamin C and K have to be gotten (in small amounts) from eating organ meats which contain massive amounts of heavy metals.

The video also doesn't at all mention the longest living dietary group on earth the okinawans which ate almost an exclusively plant based diet.

Zerocarb or the keto diet have more sources of dietary cholesterol (which means the get more cholesterol in their blood), one of the leading causes of heart disease and strokes.

&gt; While PETA’s stance on euthanasia is controversial, we could find little evidence it has been extended to family pets with any frequency. PETA workers were arrested over pet theft incidents in 2007 and 2014, but the intent of the workers in those cases was not sufficiently clear to consider their actions unlawful. Aside from those two incidents, we’ve found no evidence supporting the claim that PETA regularly takes household pets from their homes and euthanizes them. 

In 40 years of PETA's existence, only two scenarios like that ever happened, and in both cases, no charges were brought against the workers because the evidence suggested their actions were accidental (ie the pets' owners were shitbags who didn't take care of them, so the PETA workers though the dogs were abused strays).",0

Both required a non-refundable application fee, a formal interview and a waiting period before I was given the authorization to adopt a dog from them. While I understand the idea behind these tactics to ensure someone is serious, these barriers don't exist when buying a dog outright. It is difficult for a shelter to compete which a breeder when the barriers are so high at the shelter.
I was helping my grandmother adopt a dog from a rescue and she went through the entire process of the application, site visit and interview and was given the ok to adopt a dog from the interviewer. The day before she was to adopt the dog, the rescue called and said that they could not adopt a dog from them because of her age. Her age had not changed from when the process started a month before.The shelter did get to keep the application fee so I guess they got theirs. Defeated by the process, she bought a dog.

vegan,62,"We are not herbivores at all. It's only propagandist vegans that purport this garbage that is totally unsubstantiated.

Without meat humans would have never got to the point we have today. Yes it's now unnecessary, but that's only in very recent history when looking at the whole of our existence. It's due to our flexibility that we were able to live in vastly different areas across the globe, before the advent of agriculture. 

Doesn't help you have vegan doctors like Dr Milton Mills (Medical doctor, specialising in HIV) that push this nonsense, when he is totally uneducated on the topic. Hasn't studied evolutionary biology/anthropology a day in his life and think he's qualified to pass judgment on this topic. Nor does he have a single peer reviewed paper on the topic - wonder why? Because his asinine conclusions are complete and utter conjecture, and many of his points he's completely twisted it to fit his agenda. It would be like a physicist making videos on YouTube about subjects w.r.t dentistry. Vegans are very quick to point out doctors aren't educated on nutrition, they sure as hell aren't educated on Hominin evolution. 

Humans are omnivores. But yes, we shouldn't act as omnivores anymore, thanks to modern agriculture and technology we have other options.

I suggest you read books/literature by actual world renowned experts. You can read these as a starting point for a beginner:

Lots of people are also very allergic to it (more so than just lactose intolerance). Its also bad for your skin. 

And in the US at the very least there are very lax rules on how pure the milk has to be so a lot of milk has fairly high levels of pus and blood in it that is ""bleached"" out. 

Then there is the whole deal with cows and factory farming being horrible for the environment which also directly impacts ones health. So all around its just bad. 

Oat milk, at least environmentally is the best milk to drink as it requires the least amount of resources to produce! And cows milk is far and away the worst obviously.

Their main considerations are violence against humans, which they consider a vegan diet to be.

\- They do not believe that beta carotene can be converted to vitamin A (largely) and they cling to case reports of people without the enzyme to convert beta carotene without consideration for how rare that is.

\- They say you cannot get b12 from a vegan diet, and that supplementation is unhealthy and makes us beholden to exogenous chemicals.

\- They say you cannot get vitamin D from a vegan diet. If you say you can get it through the sun, they point to the parts of the world where that's not available year round and ask why you hate people and want to condemn them to vitamin D deficiency. If you say you can get D3 in supplement form from lichen they say you cannot that you can only get it from animal hormones. If you say you can get it from D2 from mushrooms they say you cannot because it doesn't convert to a useable form.

\- They say you need cholesterol from exogenous sources, and like their other claims, cling to case reports of people who cannot create endogenous cholesterol.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically they grasp tightly to an idea of nature and evolution dictating perfection. If it's not natural, it's not healthy (they somehow believe us to be carnivores, but whatever). If it doesn't work for every human, then it's not healthy for any human (ignoring their own lab values, but whatever). If you point them at studies, they'll say the studies are lies or completely intentionally misinterpret them (S3vrge telling humane hancock that the adventist health studies showed pescatarians to have the best outcomes ([they had the 2nd worst outcomes, after omnivores](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1f/61/50/1f6150e2bd5ac24fab6a05d06c8a6bb6.jpg))) Yeah they'll throw in ""crop deaths from harvesting"" and ""grass fed is best"" as distractors, but their main issues are listed above.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to talk to these guys, you need to have your ethical arguments down, but also have your studies right in front of you because they'll straight up lie to your face.

Basically, the breeders that they get the chickens from still slaughter male chicks, hens will still tend to eat their own eggs to supplement calcium, and eggs are unnecessary to consume. One major point of veganism is to no longer view animals as machines who produce products for us, but rather independent individuals who have a preference to simply live their own lives.",0
vegan,63,"The hardest part about veganism is time management, meal preparation, and food access while you’re not home. You have to plan more for meals, otherwise you’ll be too hungry and go back to eating the convenient foods like you used to. 
I rely heavily on smoothies as meal replacements at least once a day. I make sure to add chia seed, flax seed, berries, greens, fruit, and cooked beans that are frozen as added protein. 
Get a vitamix. It’s completely worth it. 

You have to learn how to cook and more often. Otherwise it’ll be rough and you’ll rely on too much junk and your health will suffer. Millions of vegan recipes on Instagram, YouTube. You can veganaise everything you used to eat. 

It’s easy to under eat when starting out vegan cuz plants are less calorically dense. Eat nuts, beans, rice, potatoes, avocado to feel fuller. 
Keep watching vegan YouTube: nutrition facts.org, plant based news, earthling Ed,. 

Find your reason for making this change. For me it was for my health at first, now I do it for the animals. The animals are the victims and i refuse to participate in this barbaric system of cruelty and mass murder. Find your reason because there will be days where you’ll want to cave and eat fast food while you’re out. You have to plan accordingly and not give in. If you do, forgive yourself and start again. 

Also, you will be more bloated. It’s your microbiome of your guts not being used to digesting increased fiber amounts. There will be an adjustment period spanning a few months. 

You’ll definitively get judged by friends and family. They will comment negatively and it will be tempting to argue. Be calm and don’t take the bait. They need to do their own research and you can’t expect yourself to be their teacher. Assure them you know what you’re doing, and answer their questions concisely without defensiveness. 

Keep researching, keep growing.

Afterwards, are they also protesting people claiming to eat a ""hot dog"" unless they're eating actual puppers? Do we need to add ""eggs"" to ""eggplant"" to make it legit?

Because of this, the Inuit diet is something like 90% meat including raw meat and animal blubber. Meat eaters, keto dieters, paleo dieters etc. like to point to Inuits as proof that high-meat diets are sustainable and very healthy.

And yeah, Inuits survive on these diets. But they are far from perfectly healthy : Inuit populations have really high rates of stroke and their heart disease rate is slightly higher than typical Western populations. There are also some risks to kidney and liver health with these diets. Also, contrary to popular belief, Inuit people are *not* in permanent ketosis, because they consume plenty of carbohydrates from the glycogen in uncooked meat and fat. So it’s a fallacious argument; but meat eaters don’t really care, they just want to pretend they’re better than vegans.",0

I didn't want to go vegan, but I couldn't really justify eating animals to myself so I thought ""I'll give up red meat for a while."" I intended it to be only a temporary thing. After a few months I thought to myself ""Wow, this really isn't that difficult, maybe I'll try cutting out some other meat."" This happened every few months until eventually I realized that I might as well just go vegan. 

It was a slow 18 month transition that ended up with me going vegan almost by accident. That was over twenty years ago now. 

It's worth noting that I was a dumb kid at the time and if someone tried to get me to go vegan overnight, there's a good chance it would have backfired and made me fall back into the whole ""vegans are pushy extremists"" mentality.

So I think it's fair to advocate for whatever works to best to push along this change in our culture. Obviously it would be preferable for everyone to go vegan overnight, but unfortunately people are extremely conditioned, so sometimes the slow baby-step approach is necessary.

I don't doubt that in time, as veganism becomes more popular and easy, the rate of overnight veganism will increase significantly.",0

""Now here’s the thing. I believe strongly through my own research and experience that the vegan movement has taken so long to actually come to fruition because of this one simple fact: we have not been promoting it as veganism. We’ve been promoting it as a diet, as something people can do gradually, et cetera. The reason why it’s going slower because of that is because we would never do that with any other injustice. We would never say, “Racism is wrong, but on Sundays, fine. Just- do it in a park somewhere we don’t have to look, it’s okay, just maybe cut down gradually and you’ll become a non-racist one day.” Do you know what I mean? We would never say, “Child abuse is unacceptable, but if you’re addicted to it- I know what it’s like. Maybe just only keep the kicking of the children in the face- maybe keep that to Sundays or do it just one day a week.” We would never say that, so my point is, we should just be promoting what is morally correct and that is that no form of animal exploitation is morally-justified, and we should be showing people how easy it is to go vegan, and if you want to do less then do less, but we’re not going to compromise on something that is so simple and is so urgent.""

&gt;  
&gt;But it’s not just the increasing population of vegans and vegetarians driving demand. Americans are becoming more health conscious, with one-third of the population now identifying as flexitarian (someone who eats mostly plant based). 

[Here's the original source](https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4959853/top-trends-in-prepared-foods-2017-exploring-trends-in-meat-fish-and-seafood-pasta-noodles-and-rice-prepared-meals-savory-deli-food-soup-and-meat-substitutes.html) for the first point. 6% sounds kinda high, and I can't find what population they surveyed without paying for a license. As great as it would be I find it *really* hard to believe that 1/3 of Americans are actively reducing animal product consumption, and they don't cite a source for this at all.

The law says that, when a ***public*** building/service has a canteen, there must be a vegetarian (that's the exact word used) option in the daily menus, alongside the regular options. That means public hospitals and health centers, public-funded retirement homes, public schools for all ages, public universities, prisons and any sort of social services.

vegan,67,"**Here is the full text of my post. What could I have done better? I used a lot of embedded images in my email, which can't be added to a reddit comment.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

We really enjoyed the talk by Dr. Shiva. However, I  am a little disappointed by the choice of refreshments served after the  talk, especially considering the talk dealt with the importance of  preserving biodiversity and open spaces.Before you dismiss my disappointment, please allow me to make my case:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There’s a single, major occupant on all this land: cows. Between pastures and cropland used to produce feed, **41 percent of U.S. land in the contiguous states revolves around livestock.**

Source: [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/)

&amp;#x200B;

Raising cattle for flesh and milk is the **primary source of deforestation and biodiversity loss across the world**, not just the United States. [In fact, according to a 2017 World Wildlife Fund (WWF) study, *Appetite for Destruction*, **60% of global biodiversity loss is due to land cleared for livestock agriculture.**](https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/appetitefordestruction)You  see this conflict between the livestock-industry and wildlife play out  time and again even in this country: from the annual culling of bison in  the Yellowstone at the behest of cattle ranchers to the killing of  wolves to protect livestock in the Pacific Northwest. And we all know  who is winning:

&amp;#x200B;

**Of all the mammals on Earth, 96% are livestock and humans, only 4% are wild mammals**

Source: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/human-race-just-001-of-all-life-but-has-destroyed-over-80-of-wild-mammals-study)

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly,  as residents of a drought-prone state, we all know that agriculture is  the primary consumer of freshwater in California. There is so much talk  of the water footprint of almonds; however, a closer inspection of the  agricultural water usage in the state shows that \*\*water usage by alfalfa and pasture far outstrips almonds.\*\*Both alfalfa and pastures - *you guessed it* \- serve as feed for beef and dairy cattle.

Source: [UC Davis; Slide 4](https://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/workgroups/lcfssustain/hanson.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

With these arguments, I am **NOT** even  trying to make a case against serving animal-based products for  animal-welfare, health or even climate-change related reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

The points above illustrate that **serving  food from an industry that is devouring all open spaces around the  world and driving biodiversity loss and extinction contradicts the  valuable and important work of organizations like** ***\[name of organization\]*****.**

&amp;#x200B;

People  look up to organizations like *\[name of organization\]* to lead the way forward for a better  world; please consider my case with an open mind and be part of the  needed change.",0

vegan,68,"Sure thing! I preheat my oven to 500° F (may be different with yours).

Have a seasoned cast-iron skillet on standby.

I use Trader Joe's pizza dough. You can use Garlic &amp; Herb, but roommate and I found it's much better with the regular for the dough rising.

I like to use a tomato sauce that is not high in sugar like most store-bought brands, but go with what you like. I sometimes make my own with just tomatoes, a little salt, and some dried basil and blend.

My cheese is Miyoko's vegan mozz. I swear the recipe for that cheese has gotten better or I am just loving it more and more.

I also used to Field Roast Italian Sausage for a topping, but go with what you like!

So anywho, take dough that is enough to cover the bottom of the skillet and the bottom side as well. Flour your work space and your hands. Roll out your dough or flatten with your hands if you want, but make sure you don't have areas that are too thicc, unless you like it THICC. 

When ready, you can either put a little bit of olive oil at the bottom of the skillet - not a lot, just enough to cover the bottom very lightly - and place the dough inside covering the bottom and a little bit of the sides as well. I like to press up against the sides of the dough and make it a little thiccer there for the classic crust. I love me my crust. 

When you're satisfied, it's time for the sauce! BUT WAIT! I put a teaspoon of olive oil on the top and spread it like polio, getting the top surface layered with God's own lubricant and sure-to-butter-your-crust-secret. TL;DR put just enough olive oil to cover the top before you add sauce. You can use your hands and get it that way or use the back of a spoon; your choice.

Put about a tablespoon of sauce and spread in a spiralled motion. Add more if you'd like, but don't be a complete monster about it. We're already pissing off the Italians enough as it is. Jokes aside, I go with the ""a little goes a long way"" approach to sauce, but feel free to add more if it isn't your preference for just a little.

Hot tip: brush some sauce on the end crust with a cruelty-free basting brush! Makes it taste real nice.

You can shred your Miyoko's or vegan mozz of choice and sprinkle a bit over the top. My way of telling if it's enough cheese if it is showing 25% sauce throughout, it will melt and cover the rest during baking. You can also just cover the shit out of that thing with all cheese and no sauce visible, but I live in Seattle and living ain't cheap, ya'll! Again, preference is fine here.

Add whatever toppings you'd like! Just make sure it's vegan or I'll probably cry. I used Field Roast and just picked it apart and arbitrarily threw it on.

Bake at 500°F for 20 minutes (for my oven) on the middle rack and check it then. Judge by the crust. Remove with a pot holder (the skillet will be hot) and add dried basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes if you're feeling like a bold boy or girl. Cut and serve only to yourself because nobody deserves your amazing pizza you made! But it really is a good single serving portion of pizza, but it is good to share with others!

Hope this idiot's recipe works some anyone of you. I make this about twice a week - and yes, I am fat.",0

As a vegan and pro-choice, I must Admit that this subject is complex and it makes me question my beliefs. If you do not question yourself, you are no better than meat-eaters who refuse to question their practices.



Edit: yes I know abortion is not allowed at 25 week, it was just to say we all agree on this transition but we don't know really when it happens and how.

I literally didn’t even know people ate cows until I was in middle school. I genuinely didn’t think they were considered ‘edible’. 

Dogs also aren’t considered food in my country, but they are considered pests (they spread rabies and other diseases) and strays are often euthanised/ killed (I’m not aware of the process and I wouldn’t be surprised if they were killed by slitting their throats or something). 

When I saw anti-Yulin posts from people who regularly eat beef, it made zero sense to me. Cows are treated more like pets than dogs are, where I live. It all comes down to culture and social conditioning.

Women who were told about the video reported significantly less meat eating vs the control group, but men who were told about the video reported *more* meat eating (granted, the men's difference wasn't statistically significant, but it's definitely in the raw data).

vegan,70,"Hey friend, I was just like you. I ate meat for 31 years, and even have my photo on the wall of a burger joint for eating a gigantic beef burger. I made the vegan change overnight after watching [the doco Dominion](https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch) and 3 months on haven't looked back. What amazed me was how easy it was to do! At the supermarket, instead of getting meat, I just grab some tofu or similar product (that's just my preference, there's heaps of vegan alternatives available). Instead of dairy milk, I just walk a few steps over there, extend my arm and grab soy milk (or almond, or rice, or coconut, or oat etc...) instead. Easy peasy, the food is actually damn tasty, and I feel better than ever! And it's only getting better and easier everyday as veganism [rapidly becomes more popular](https://subredditstats.com/r/vegan).

Yes, it is true that becoming vegan will [greatly help the environment](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts). Check out the doco Cowspiracy on netflix for more on that. In my mind, this is just a bonus, along with the health benefits (check out the doco Forks Over Knives for more on that). Also, the largest organisation of registered dietitians on Earth, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, have [released a statement](https://www.eatrightpro.org/-/media/eatrightpro-files/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/vegetarian-diet.pdf) that a vegan diet is healthy for ALL stages of life.

Yes, I love the taste of meat too. But after [having my arguments debunked](http://www.squitti.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/30-Non-Vegan-Excuses-and-How-to-Respond-to-Them-by-Earthling-Ed_LoRes.pdf), I came to the conclusion, that life is more valuable than taste. You don't even have to like animals, or rank the life of an animal at the same level as your own, you just need to recognise that their life is more important than how they taste. And honestly, once you make that connection, you'll feel so much better mentally (no more [cognitive dissonance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNerOJxtBh0)), and check out this BAFTA-winning 15 minute doco [73 Cows](https://mailchimp.com/presents/film/73-cows/) for more on that.

There is a great alternative to the current status quo that can compete with it in texture (and arguably taste), while blowing it completely out of the water in terms of ethical and environmental aspects, also exceeding the nut milks.

vegan,70,"Zookeeper here. There's major movement in the industry toward natural behaviour promotion, which has been good for the animals' welfare (though guests complain sometimes - ""hOw aM I mEAnT tO seE tHe kOaLa alL tHe WaY uP iN ThAt TrEe?"")

My workplace is a free-roaming native animal sanctuary - a fenced-in feral-proof area where animals are not contained, but are humanised (i.e
Wallabies roam across many acres of natural bush like wild wallabies, BUT dont have the fear of humans that wild wallabies would have). That's a goal for many places these days. 

But there are always going to be some safety restrictions - e.g. much as I'd like to let my rescue peregrine free-roam, I know she'll kill every duck in sight and possibly land on humans, so she needs a large aviary instead. Likewise, much as I joke to the boss about having a free-roaming saltwater croc, it prooobbabbllyy wouldnt get approved.

And the last type of animal that gets enclosed are the ""education team"" - highly humanised animals that come out for encounters (and they have the choice to participate or not). These animals have periods of high human interaction, meaning their enclosures should be off-display to give them a break from humans afterward. Again, a growing trend. Theyre the moneymakers. And as much as people condemn the use of animals to make money - conservation needs funding. So we humanise them to remove fear of humans, give them the choice to participate (i.e. offer the transport box/glove/pouch and see if they come over or not) and give them long periods of quiet and rest afterward.",0

vegan,70,"Hey friend, I was just like you. I ate meat for 31 years, and even have my photo on the wall of a burger joint for eating a gigantic beef burger. I made the vegan change overnight after watching [the doco Dominion](https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch) and 3 months on haven't looked back. What amazed me was how easy it was to do! At the supermarket, instead of getting meat, I just grab some tofu or similar product (that's just my preference, there's heaps of vegan alternatives available). Instead of dairy milk, I just walk a few steps over there, extend my arm and grab soy milk (or almond, or rice, or coconut, or oat etc...) instead. Easy peasy, the food is actually damn tasty, and I feel better than ever! And it's only getting better and easier everyday as veganism [rapidly becomes more popular](https://subredditstats.com/r/vegan).

Yes, it is true that becoming vegan will [greatly help the environment](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts). Check out the doco Cowspiracy on netflix for more on that. In my mind, this is just a bonus, along with the health benefits (check out the doco Forks Over Knives for more on that). Also, the largest organisation of registered dietitians on Earth, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, have [released a statement](https://www.eatrightpro.org/-/media/eatrightpro-files/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/vegetarian-diet.pdf) that a vegan diet is healthy for ALL stages of life.

Yes, I love the taste of meat too. But after [having my arguments debunked](http://www.squitti.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/30-Non-Vegan-Excuses-and-How-to-Respond-to-Them-by-Earthling-Ed_LoRes.pdf), I came to the conclusion, that life is more valuable than taste. You don't even have to like animals, or rank the life of an animal at the same level as your own, you just need to recognise that their life is more important than how they taste. And honestly, once you make that connection, you'll feel so much better mentally (no more [cognitive dissonance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNerOJxtBh0)), and check out this BAFTA-winning 15 minute doco [73 Cows](https://mailchimp.com/presents/film/73-cows/) for more on that.

Also, meat was associated with a sign of social class, and it was recommended by doctors and therapist as a way of fighting depression back 80 or so years ago. Eating meat was also associated with dominant/high status personalities, and not eating animals was associated with submissiveness.

vegan,71,"Hello everyone,

This might be the last time I speak as a moderator of r/vegan, so let me offer my perspective.

I know many people disagreed with our policies and decisions. Trying to make this sub a welcoming place for all vegans while simultaneously using it as an activism tool spreading vegan ideology is not easy, and everybody has their own vision on how everything should function. It’s only natural that we can’t please every single person.

What I want you to know is that the amount of work required is enormous. We’ve been constantly dealing with spammers, trolls and coordinated raids. We’re talking hundreds of animal flesh pictures every single day, “bacon tho” comments and insults directed either at particular people, or vegan community in general. 

We had to assign shifts, we had to organize, we had to come up with policies and procedures to make this job possible. All of this just so the average user has no idea how much shit is going behind the scenes.

Why am I telling you this? Because I want you to know how important communication and being involved are. We didn’t press M4124124 and sylvan to be more active because we’re a bunch of meanies, we did that because if everyone would “just do their thing”, we would stand no chance against all the brigades. We needed to work as a team, and we needed to stay in touch with each other.

Making our internal affairs public is, in my opinion, highly unprofessional. On top of that, YVFI was demodded without warning or explanation, a decision I strongly disagree with. I can’t even explain to you how much time and effort this guy dedicated to r/vegan. He spent hundreds of hours dealing with mod queue, he created tools for other moderators to use, he recruited and trained new people, he was there to help, answer our questions, correct our mistakes, and make sure we’re fine. He didn’t do anything to deserve the treatment he received.

For all these reasons, I am stepping down as a r/vegan moderator. Huge thank you to everyone who contributed to this community, and good luck to those who decide to stay and anyone who comes to replace me.",2

So it looks like people are veganizing the hell out of things which is great!",0
vegan,74,"Definitely. I got out of the restaurant industry before I became a world class chef, but even for me it was tough. 

About 10 years ago, I was a chef in a major US city at a ridiculously young age. I worked in some trendy restaurants and then Michelin star kitchen before making the jump to take over my own kitchen at 22. My young age and very different menu made me pretty famous among food writers. Within a year, I had been written about by a few newspapers, a bunch of blogs, and was cooking at the top rated Yelp spot in the city. And my signature dish was marinated meat.

One of the opportunities was to open a restaurant in Malaysia. ""Hell yeah!"" I thought because I love Kuala Lumpur.  So I returned to school to finish my BA so I could get a visa. One of my first classes was an elective about the environment where we heard how the world was basically fucked unless we took drastic action. Towards the middle, we took a footprint calculator test that gave an idea of how big of an impact on the environment we had and HOLY SHIT my eating habits are terrible. So I cut out all animal products from my diet but still served the stuff and planned to continue cooking it.

So uh, this is where the story gets fun and cringey. People started wondering about my new diet and asking me. Usually they were omnivores who ate even more meat than I did. I usually responded with some kind of cringe-inducing edge like, ""Our diets are killing the planet. No one gives a shit. So I gave up meat so you can keep eating it."" Needless to say, this really didn't go over well with most people and ruined a lot of personal and professional relationships. But I was so bitter about the state of climate change and that I was personally responsible for it that I basically just became unbearable. 

Eventually I got sick with a gallbladder issue that was misdiagnosed as Celiac disease and the deal in Malaysia fell through. I gave up cooking, other people I knew got famous with their own interpretations of my food, and I just became so alone and bitter towards the world. I dropped out of school again, took whatever odd jobs I could, and returned to eating anything as long as it was labeled gluten-free. Eventually one of these jobs turned into something fairly lucrative. It didn't pay as well, it wasn't going to make me famous, and I got absolutely no respect, but I had stability and could finish my degree. I tried the vegan thing out again but it didn't take.

Fast forward to the spring of 2018. I was working as an organizer at a nonprofit. I was feeling great about what I was doing, but still gluten-free and still eating meat. On impulse, I took a 23andme test. A month later, I got it back saying I didn't have the genes for Celiac disease. I went on a pizza binge and ate loads of cheap Chinese takeout, but I still wasn't happy. Then a fellow organizer and awesome vegan gave me a gentle push to the vegan path again. But this time, it wasn't about the environment but about how animals are suffering in the name of colonialism. I did some reading up and stuff and a few days later I started on the vegan path again.

It has been 7 months this time and I haven't had the urge to look back at all. I'm embarrassed by how I so casually helped take the lives of animals. I did it so people would think I was awesome enough to give money to and write about. I did it for my own fucking ego, and I regret all of it. In fact, when I see some of the dishes I created reproduced on other menus, I get sick to my stomach because I know that I am partly to blame for an animal losing its life for some person to throw their flesh into their mouths for a few moments of fun before getting distracted by something else. 

By no means was I a world class chef nor was I in the industry as long as someone like Gordon Ramsey. I don't know if I could have done it without hitting rock bottom or if I had stayed in the industry. Celebrity chefs are going to always have their place in the food world no matter how far they try to run from it. Every young chef they inspired, rerun of a TV show, or cookbook with their name on it is going to fill them with regret when they fully accept that the meat on their plate was a living, breathing, innocent animal who just wanted to live and be treated compassionately. And it is why I will cheer on chefs like Gordon Ramsey or Guy Fieri who actively support vegan diets or talk about eating vegan meals at home, even if they never become vegans themselves. ",0

Not surprisingly, their funding comes from tobacco companies, fast food, etc. The scary thing is that people readily eat up their bullshit, I even occasionally see vegans on this sub parrot talking points from PetaKillsAnimals (a website run by the CCF).

I must say though, I do strongly disagree with PETA's recent remarks about Steve Irwin. The man's done far more good for animals than most people in history, and it seems rather pointless to criticize him for temporarily annoying a handful of wild animals (who were ultimately all unharmed) when the amount of animals tortured and killed for their flesh in a millisecond equals more animals than the man ever touched in his life.

vegan,75,"I think we should stop referring to palm oil as non-vegan.

We both agree on the definition of veganism-- avoiding harm as far as yadda  yadda-- and we both agree that palm oil sourced in the most common way is harmful to orangutans.

The problem is, palm oil itself is a product, not a method of production. And orangutans, while important ecologically, shouldn't be granted any ""special status"" ethically, as if harm to their home is 100% nonvegan, while harm to a rabbit den is a trivial side effect.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to get into the weeds here, as I understand there will be a lot of charged emotions any time someone brings up harm of animals inherent to cultivation of crops, since that is a common carnist critique of veganism. And I also understand some may give higher status to orangutans due to their mental faculties. You may even consider endangerment of a species as an ethical issue, and I suppose calling it an ecological issue doesn't somehow make it not an ethical issue too. Okay, fair, I accept all of those criticism.

&amp;#x200B;

But on a fundamental level, if we start classifying things as ""vegan"" and ""non-vegan"" based not on what is fundamental and inherent to the product, but based on a common method of producing it, I think we confuse the issue and muddy the water.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we should treat palm oil like we would a makeup product. If a lipstick is not vegan, it's not (usually) because of the product, but because that particular company tests on animals. Likewise, we shouldn't call palm oil non-vegan, we should talk about a particular product from a particular company containing palm oil non-vegan.

I understand erring on the side of caution, and assuming non-vegan until told otherwise, and that's fair. Heck, I'd love if we treated palm oil like makeup here too-- it's hard to research, so if you want me to use your product, label your sourcing in a way that makes it clear it didn't lead to massive habitat destruction.",0

“Not long ago I also had a talk with a retired soldier, a butcher, and he too was surprised by my assertion that it was a pity to kill, and he said the usual things about its being ordained; but afterwards he agreed with me: 'Especially when they are quiet, tame cattle. They come, poor things, trusting you. It is very pitiful.'
This is dreadful! Not the suffering and death of the animals, but that man suppresses in himself, unnecessarily, the highest spiritual capacity - that of sympathy and pity toward living creatures like himself - and by violating his own feelings he becomes cruel. And how deeply seated in the human heart is the injunction not to take life! But by the assertion that God ordained the slaughter of animals, and above all as a result of habit, people entirely lose their natural feeling.”

“If a man aspires to a righteous life, his first act of abstinence is from injury to animals.”

“A man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food; therefore, if he eats meat, he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetites. And to act so is immoral.”",0

Its sad to see even vegans here drink the koolaid, when this blatant blasphemy of PETA was actually partially funded by meat and dairy industries to continue funding the propaganda(and many people use that term loosely, google the word, this is what they did to PETA. Commerical lies and strawmans).

All these “no kill shelters” which may appear virtuous at first, are actually passing on the load to other shelters so that they have to do the dirty deed which is killing the animals, because there is no space for them anymore. (too much dogs and very little adoption). Now PETA can either place dogs out in the streets (square 1) or euthanize them. So thats what they did. So I mean you can still object to that, you could say “maybe they should of let the dogs outside” but the narrative that has been painted on PETA was disingenuous, it was not as simple as “we wanted to kill some dogs because fun”. 

Peta themselves did a response to the criticism.
https://www.peta.org/blog/euthanize/

People pick points about why they like or dislike PETA, but their euthanization seems to be an easily defensible act. And overall, I don’t think you can argue that PETA is doing more harm than good. That just sounds extremely ignorant. PETA’s own tools and resources and education help so much people.

(If someone here has the source regarding the pro-meat propaganda that would be great. Regardless PETA’s reponse should be enough to end this controversy blown out of the water, where the effects of this blasphemy is still affecting PETA today).",0

vegan,78,"Half the people that responded to a poll last year had stayed vegan. My sister did it and is vegan now still. It's the most positive vegan campaign there has ever been with the amount of people doing it and restaurants and supermarkets getting on board, and the discussion it creates. Not to mention the added boon to vegan businesses to keep running. It also lets people just say that they are doing it for a month which takes some pressure off them. 

I gave 2 friends the veganuary book on how to go vegan (I bought it jist for that kind of thing and have just skimmed it myself) and they are vegan now. They mostly liked how it was not judgemental or condescending and they felt it made things a lot easier. They also said the same about me which felt really great.

My brother and his girlfriend did veganuary too, she is vegetarian now and he is on and off, with him now saying that veganism is ethically right. Great steps even when it hasn't fully worked. They never would have even thought about it before trying something like that themselves.


I can definitely see how it can be annoying in cases like the OP and I deal with it too. Veganism being discussed at all is what keeps me going. The more the better, even my friend doing it once a week is a huge step from his flat out no before. Will work on that ;)

This normalisation has even started my mother drinking oat milk, eating hummus and all sorts of vegan foods. You have no idea how set in her ways this woman is, it's taken me decades to get her to roast veg instead of boil them at Christmas haha. Before she wouldn't even try any vegan food and now goes to restaurants with me etc, whereas she would still have gone with me before but would just order nothing. She loves the food now, moving in the right direction.

Animal agriculture takes much more land for less calorie density. So right there, you can see that animal agriculture is worst in terms of wasting resources. This article did an analysis of environmental impact of sample diets (omni, vegetarian and vegan). The issue of shitty vegan products (almonds/almond milk is pretty bad) does exist, but its completely false to state that eating plants is worse for the environment than eating meat.  I have linked four studies here, all of which are pretty recent.

It's [cherry picking](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cherry_picking) a poor representative of the group – almost a [straw man](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man) – to use as [ad hominem](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) against the group. For example, [antifeminists](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Antifeminist) frequently paint [feminists](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Feminist) as ""[feminazis](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Feminazi)"" by highlighting examples of ridiculous or cringey feminist behavior, rather than by critiquing mainline feminist writings.[\[1\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nutpicking#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nutpicking#cite_note-2) In other words: every movement has crazies, but not every movement is crazy. The proper questions are: ""Does this movement *promote* crazies?"" and ""Does this movement have *proportionately more* crazies?""

Recently, a stranger behind me in a supermarket commented on both the soya milk (Alpro do a [""growing up"" milk](https://i.imgur.com/gz3S2A9.jpg) and my daughter fucking loves it) and Monster Energy in my shopping.

""Excuse me, but do you know the damage you're doing to your children with all the oestrogen in soya? Not to mention the damage to yourself with those drinks?!""

I glanced in her basket. Bacon, huge block of cheese, cow's milk and multiple packs of these little bags of processed, flavoured meat things, ""Fridge Raiders"" or something...

This woman was maybe late 40's. About 5'5"", quite overweight and had nicotine stained fingers. (Not slamming her for being overweight or anything, just trying to paint a picture, I was over 250lbs 5 years ago after a number of health problems (had my knee rebuilt, then a year later I had a stroke and put on a fair amount of weight during the downtime/recovery from both))

I'm 6'1"", 180lbs, I carry my youngest kid in a carrier rather than using a pram and generally try to keep quite active. I'm a little soft around the middle but not unhealthy.

""It's okay, I'm not worried about her consuming phytoestrogens because **she's not a fucking plant!** It's the mammalian oestrogen found in dairy that I would be ashamed of myself for feeding my kid.

As for the energy drink, not that it's any of your business, but it's 9am, I've been up for 4 hours as my youngest decided to do a shit at 5am, so decided to have a wee boost to get me through the day. Now, if you would kindly fuck right along, I've had enough of you, now.""

Honestly, I never used to engage people at all, was always quite shy and was none confrontational.

Since having kids, though, that all changed. It started when I noticed people would frequently touch my daughter. If she was in the carrier or the pram as a baby, people would touch her, pinch her cheek or generally just place their hands on her. I didn't like it, she didn't like it. She would pull away and try to squirm away from them. 

Since seeing how uncomfortable it made her, something changed and now, the slightest hint of approaching my kids, questioning our moral decisions or lifestyle choice and I put myself between them and my kids, to a fault a lot of the time, though as I don't really have a filter anymore. I had a stroke a few years ago in my 20's and it seems that it essentially switched off my internal filter... **shrugs** ah well...",0

vegan,83,"Kudos to you guys -- and for finding a veg-friendly doc, especially in a rural area!!

I also just want to also warn you that you all won't stay healthy for too many more years if you don't get B12 supplementation one way or another. That can be fortified nut milks, fortified nutritional yeast, etc. -- but it's easier and far more reliable to just take one 2,500 mcg B12 tablet once a week as an adult. I'm not sure the recommended dose for children, but the published medical literature is replete with vegan child case studies from B12 deficiency. (Check Pubmed yourself.) We adults have about maybe 1-2 years of B12 stores, and then deficiency sets in. Given the importance of B12 for brain development, wouldn't risk it with children. 

Even vegan-MD advocate extraordinaire Dr. Michael Greger warns that vegans don't adequately supplement with B12: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegan-epidemic/ The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics blessed well-planned vegan diets for all ages and stages too, but also cites the need for B12 supplementation.

Some people say B12 supplementation isn't ""natural,"" but breastfed babies need Vitamin D supplementation and no one says that breastfeeding is unnatural. Such necessities are just a function of our artificial environments (like we don't have our babies outside much for natural Vitamin D or eat veggies full of soil microbes for natural B12). 

Other than wanting to make sure you knew how universal B12 supplementation recommendations are among vegan nutrition experts -- which include the world's biggest vegan advocates -- congratulations on a wonderful check up! When we first went vegan, our kids were 9 and 6. We had them tested annually, then every other year, and now only once in a while. Everything was always fine! Eight years later, they wouldn't eat animal products even if we stopped being vegan. They find them disgusting to even contemplate eating! I have to admit I still worried a little as a mother until I met a man raised vegan since before birth who's a PhD biology professor. Definitely nothing wrong with him or his brain! :) ",0

Veganism is the opposition to animal abuse.

Vegans make the choice to stop abusing animals.

&amp;nbsp;

Consumption of animal products is unnecessary for health and nutrition.

[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704/)

&gt;It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes.

vegan,87,"&gt;Thank you for getting in touch regarding Cure Cancer’s BarbeCURE campaign.  
&gt;  
&gt;We always appreciate any input and have taken your comments on board. However, we would like to assure you that a huge amount of careful thought and consideration went into the campaign prior to it being launched. This included:  
&gt;  
&gt;i) Thorough reviews of reports from the World Health Organisation that focus on red meat, processed meat and the consumption of burnt or charred food from a barbecue.  
&gt;  
&gt;ii) The benefits of creating an event that was quintessentially Australian and did not involve intensive organisation or expense by participants.  
&gt;  
&gt;iii) The need to promote an initiative that would bring people together to raise crucial funds and awareness of cancer research.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cure Cancer has consulted with a number of other cancer organisations, our researchers and nutritionists, and come to the decision that we can make a positive contribution to the debate around meat consumption by promoting healthy barbecuing techniques.  We endorse the inclusion of vegetables, salads and alternatives to meat, and advise the consumption of red meat in moderation. Information on safe barbecuing techniques are readily available on our website.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cure Cancer have included a wide variety of information, tips and recipes here:

I contacted them recently.  They're basically saying - BBQ's are fun, so it doesn't matter that they promote eating carcinogens, because it makes them money. ""We took consideration of the WHO recommendations""  AND THEN COMPLETELY IGNORED THEM lol.

&amp;#x200B;

They don't want to cure cancer or prevent cancer. They want the public to pay for them to develop a drug (thru donations). And then they want people to continue to develop cancer, so that they can sell them a pill. Brilliant business model, and totally unethical.

vegan,87,"Both. Orcas travel for long distances in the wild, it’s essential to their development and health, trapping them in a small pool is similar to keeping a human locked in a closet for their entire lives. Orcas are also extremely social animals, they form relationships and hierarchies. Some orcas even have accents in their vocal calls depending on which pod they come from. Taking an orca from one pod and forcing it into another “pod” is brutal. Imagine if you were taken from your family and made to live with strangers in a closet. 

But Seaworld is also really bad with its practices. They impregnate whales several times, even when it’s not healthy for them. They keep whales that fight in close contact, sometimes using orca aggression as a disciplinary tactic when the orcas don’t perform as well. There have been several instances of animals being hurt at Seaworld. ",0

vegan,87,"Buddy, I _really_ feel you on this.

I went vegetarian over a decade ago, and slowly made the transition over to plant-based, and then went vegan. However, I grew up on a farm in Northern California raising, killing, butchering, and eating various ""food"" animals (e.g. cows, pigs, chickens, goats, etc.) while also raising and caring for various ""non-food"" animals (e.g. horses, dogs, cats, etc.). My father was a large animal veterinarian, and tagging along with him gave me the opportunity to also see how CAFOs (i.e. ""factory farms"" ) look from the inside; I've been to many different farms in subsequent years, some large, some small, some factory level, some family level, and I am intimately familiar with what happens there, be it terms of nutrition, animal psychology, or the abuses that can and do happen throughout the system.

It's always wonderful to see someone else come to veganism from a background in animal agribusiness as you did. So... Thanks for being you!

That's just one outlet for their misinformation-campains, they are also cited in lots of blogs and ""news articles"" as well, so it's not always very obvious.

PETA does a good job at raising issues. Sometimes they (willfully?) overshoot, that happens when you try to move the border of current perceptions. They are certainly nowhere near as bad as their current public image suggests though. Due to their [success](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/milestones/) they are a [prime](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/victories/) target for smear campaigns.

The only [obviously wrong](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/17/peta-sorry-for-taking-girls-dog-putting-it-down) thing that comes to mind is how they mistook a family pet chihuaha for a stray and put it down without respecting the 5 day grace period.

If you have any other concerns about PETA, would you please share them as response? I am trying to fight misinformation, not play defense for anyone, therefore I'd be happy to learn about bad stuff they might be doing as well.

Ok, from strictly a physiological and scientific point of view, what the animal ate does not matter. It will affect the body in a negative way whether it ate grass or rainbows and glitter. So scientifically speaking, that's garbage. Also, killing an animal whether it ate grass or magical fairy dust doesn't matter either. Like that animal volunteered its life.

&gt;The groups have deceptively helpful-sounding names, like ""Guest Choice Network,"" the ""Employment Policies Institute"" or the ""**Center for Consumer Freedom**,"" but really serve as **well-funded attack dogs for the tobacco, alcohol, chain restaurant, tanning and other industries.** The groups' non-profit status makes their funding hard to trace, which has permitted Berman to operate in the shadows for decades while pocketing millions from unpopular industries for his work thwarting public interest legislation. 

He attacks PETA, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and pushes for industries like tobacco and alcohol. There's a lot of money to be made in twisting the truth and confusing people when it benefits corporations that have the truth stacked up against them.

Now, I'm not saying to not trust his message on PETA just because of the source it came from (as that would be fallacious reasoning), but I hope knowing this is at least enough to make you question the validity of Berman's anti-PETA claims and make you investigate the issue yourself further.

By the way. I'm not a vegan. But a few months ago I followed a lot of vegan accounts and hashtags for my work research. It really affected me and makes me want to stop eating meat and dairy. I find myself always making better choices with food, like choosing vegan/vegetarian options 80% of the time. When I saw this video, I decided I want to take a bigger step towards becoming completely vegan. I know it's always been like that, which is why I say I was naive. I hope they shut down these dairy factories, the most fucked up thing I've seen in my life. 

I'm gonna make a post about this to see if I can get some good advice on ""converting"", I heard it can't be so sudden or something. I really dunno anything. All I know is i want to be vegan.

Edit: guys wow!! Thank you for the support. I thought this was gonna be lost amongst all the posts/comments on this sub. But your responses make me feel better because I thought my post was gonna be ridiculed since I'm not vegan yet haha. But thank you all so much, I'll need your help the same way you need others.

Im starting by substituting milk for plant based, substituting meat shawarmas (im Egyptian) for falafels, eating far less beef and chicken and more beans, I still do eat fish but I'll need sometime before I cut it out. I'm learning about all the nutrition since I don't want to lose weight and want to get back to working out regularly. Once I have all that down, and a budget to support me, I don't think I'll ever look back. Thank you all again ��",0

vegan,90,"I had a similar experience. I grew up on my father’s beef ranch and was occasionally involved in the processes. Our ranch was basically exactly what people imagine when they think of an ethical source of meat - a bull is put with a herd of cows in a huge pasture so “natural” breeding, they give birth in the pastures and essentially live wild with minimal human contact on a huge amount of land, and then when the cows reach the right age/weight, they’re sold for meat. I don’t know if our cows went straight to slaughter or if they had a detour through a feedlot.

The moments of human contact were never pleasant moments though. Checking the pregnancy, branding, tagging and tattooing, castrating, dehorning, and finally slaughter. But they are all necessary for keeping the business going, and that’s how they’re justified (they’re also justified with beliefs like “cows are dumb as dirt”, “the calves aren’t crying from pain, they just don’t like being held down/want to go back to their mom”, etc). It’s all justified under the belief that meat is necessary. If we need meat then this has to happen. 

But as soon as you challenge the idea of meat being necessary, it all falls apart. All of these moments of intense pain and fear are happening for our pleasure, and that’s bullshit. It’s the best life any beef-supplying cow could ask for, and it’s still just not good enough.

&gt;I thought beekeeping was ""helpful"" to the bee problem, too. Turns out, beekeeping is a (possibly major) contributing factor into why we have this problem in the first place. Beekeepers bring non-native bees into new areas, where they compete with the local bee populations, causing die offs. The beekept populations tend to be very genetically undiverse (sourced from the same strains) and are therefore much more susceptible to die offs themselves due to disease, etc.

&gt;All that aside, bees make honey for themselves, not us. We take their life's work (3 bees life's work = 1/4 teaspoon of honey), and replace it with an inferior substitute, causing further health issues. The queen's wings are frequently clipped to prevent her from leaving, and many beekeepers find it more ""economically viable"" to let the entire hive die off over the winter in colder climates, and just buy new bees in the spring.

I have moderated here for over a year and appreciate the community support that got me here in the first place.

I simply cannot stay on the team after the unfair removal of YVFI. I have given my all here and spent many hours guarding the community from “meat” pics, “bacon tho” comments and everything else that is thrown our way. 

I would like to take this opportunity to clarify I had **zero** knowledge of M4’s disabilities before that public post. If that had been shared privately, everything would have been different. 

I am sad to leave, but here are my suggestions for those staying: 

* As you work to refine the shadowban policy, be aware that shadowbanned submissions or comments do not go the queue. Creating extra work is *not* one of the downsides of shadowbanning. Make sure the community is aware of this as the policy is discussed as they were told misinformation about how it works earlier this week.

* Consider clarifying for users in M4’s thread that many were *not* shadowbanned, despite being told so. Comments needing approval is not equivalent to a shadowban. Some users just had comments filtered for other reasons. Multiple users who have had comments filtered for further review are messaging the mods thinking they are shadowbanned.  

* From M4’s post it is clear the community has been unhappy with some of the moderating policies. Start a monthly thread where the community can give feedback and the moderator’s can be more transparent about current policy discussion. 

* Create a policy on the mod team about handling conflict. Make sure the policy clearly states that it should be handled **privately** (i.e. internal). It does no good for the community for the mod’s grievances with one another to be aired publicly. Ultimately we are just forfeiting opportunities to help non-human animals every time a post about the mods takes up significant space on our page.",2

**The first rule of discussion:** make sure that your audience feels that you respect them.

**The second rule of discussion:** conduct yourself as a respectable, dignified person.

Like it or not, people are not wholly rational creatures. Their feelings matter. You might be 100% right (which I'm not saying PETA is), but if they feel insulted, they're gonna disagree with you on principle. 

I think we can discuss the extent to which his actions were wrong. But he, undoubtedly, did a lot of good. And his apparent motivation was good. And, perhaps most importantly, he died young and left behind a wife and kids. Shitting on his grave probably isn't the most effective way to make your point.

Steve Irwin, regardless of your opinion, was at least *trying* to do good. And that, alone, should earn him respect. PETA should've at least expressed sympathy to his family and fans.

vegan,101,"OK! Let's knock each of these down for the peeps the come after:

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; Plants feel pain too.

---

Vegans draw the line at hurting sentient individuals. Plants lack nerves, let alone a central nervous system, and cannot feel pain or respond to circumstances in any deliberate way (not to be confused with the non-conscious reactions they do have). Unlike animals, plants lack the ability or potential to experience pain or have sentient thoughts, so there isn't an ethical issue with eating them. For more on this, [check out the resources on the ***""Plants Are Alive""*** fallacy page](http://yvfi.ca/plants).

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; What about the mice killed in harvesting wheat?

---

Crop fields do indeed disrupt the habitats of wild animals, and wild animals are also killed when harvesting plants. However, this point makes the case for a plant-based diet and not against it, since many more plants are required to produce a measure of animal flesh for food (often as high as 12:1) than are required to produce an equal measure of plants for food (which is obviously 1:1). Because of this, a plant-based diet causes less suffering and death than one that includes animals. For more on this, [check out the resources on the ***""Vegans Kill Animals Too""*** fallacy page](http://yvfi.ca/veganskill).

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; You can't get B12 from nature.

---

While it is true that B12 is not produced by plants, it is also not produced by animals. Rather, B12 is the byproduct of a specific bacterial synthesis that occurs in soil, some fermented plant matter, dead flesh and the guts of animals. Fortunately, this bacteria is easily mass-produced for human consumption now, and many foods are fortified with it, so there is no need to eat animals in order to receive sufficient B12. For more on this, [check out the resources on the ***""Vegans Cannot Get Enough B12""*** fallacy page](http://yvfi.ca/b12).

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; People have been factory farming for millions of years.

---

There are many hypotheses about the food our early ancestors ate, what effect it had on their overall health and the evolutionary impacts of their diets. However, while it is certainly true that they ate other animals, it is also true that they did not always do so, just as it is true that individuals, groups and societies have been thriving on plant-based diets throughout history. For more on this, [check out the resources on the ***""Our Early Ancestors Ate Meat""*** fallacy page](http://yvfi.ca/ancestors).

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; If a cow had the chance, it would eat YOU.

---

Non-human animals do many things we find unethical; they steal, rape, eat their children and engage in other activities that do not and should not provide a logical foundation for our behavior. This means it is illogical to claim that we should eat the same diet certain non-human animals do. So it is probably not useful to consider the behavior of stoats, alligators and other predators when making decisions about our own behavior. For more on this, [check out the resources on the ***""Animals Eat Animals, So I Will Too""*** fallacy page](http://yvfi.ca/carnivores).

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; Vegans don't stop talking about veganism.

---

Crazy right? Here we are as vegans, talking about vegans on a sub created by vegans for vegans to discuss veganism...

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; Why imitate meat if you don't like meat?

---

Can you show me the farmed animal shaped like a saucer or a tube?

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; Veggie burgers don't suffer enough for my palate.

---

Sadism at it's finest, buuut still not a valid reason for harming others.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; For every burger you don't eat, I'll eat two.

---

But we eat burgers all the time!

&amp;nbsp;

---

&gt; Ok. Now they don't have to come here.

PETA have been one of the more visible animal rights organizations over the years, and have historically been rather effective when it comes to exposing slaughterhouses, fur farms, circuses, and such. 
They do so through rather provocative means: think splashing models with red paint back in the '80s, putting up provocative billboards, holding fake dog barbecues, and, just recently, picking on Steve Irwin for harassing animals for entertainment on his show. This is what has triggered the latest internet shitstorm because his show was held in high regard by people who grew up with it. And though he has done quite a bit of conservation work and inspired people to care about animals, PETA does have a point. The show, if you've watched it, seems to be more about the spectacle of crocodile wrasslin' than anything else.

PETA's undercover footage has done more to get slaughterhouses to clean up their act than anything else. Dr. Temple Grandin, who has worked to improve slaughterhouse conditions for animals, has been quoted as saying that PETA did more with one ad campaign than what she did with 30 years of working with the industry (although I can't find it atm.) They've also been effective in changing peoples' minds and inspiring the vegan movement, which, though contained in the years before the internet, is exploding in popularity and threatening animal product producers' markets.

PETA is quite a threat to these enterprises, and they've responded by funding a thorough smear campaign against them. Places like ""petakillsanimals.com"", which is funded by the ""Center for Consumer Freedom"", a morally bankrupt organisation that lobbies the government on behalf of tobacco, alcohol, and fast and junk food manufacturers to do things like lobby against blood alcohol limits and cigarette taxes and smear organizations like MADD who support them.

Their biggest point usually draws from PETA's feral pet control and euthanasia programs. PETA takes in and euthanizes the 'hopeless cases' of animals which are suffering due to abuse or medical problems or are unadoptable due to behavioral problems. These are animals that ""no kill"" shelters reject and refuse to house. PETA takes the position that it is better for them to have a clean, merciful death than to suffer further. PETA also offers free euthanasia for pet owners who cannot afford a vet to do so.

PETA have euthanized about 30,000-40,000 animals over the 30+ years they have been operating. By comparison, humane societies, animal control, and other 'kill shelters' destroy about 2 million animals *per year.*

Think what you will about the ethics of running a 'kill shelter', but there's an unavoidable problem of the number of pet animals born into the world and not adopted by responsible people. There simply aren't infinite housing and care resources for a forever-expanding number of pets. The best solution would be for these animals never to be born in the first place, but not everyone does the responsible thing of neutering their pets, and people insist on having specially-bred pets, which requires breeders to produce far more than people can reasonably adopt.  

PKA harp on two incidents where PETA have killed animals which have belonged to people who did not want them killed. In one incident, they were called in to take care of a feral dog colony that occupied a trailer park and was harassing a farmer's cattle. Residents were given fair warning that all animals left outside and found without a collar or identification would be rounded up and euthanized. One animal did belong to someone: a chihuahua dog, which they lured away from someone's front porch with a treat. Again, this dog was without a collar or any form of identification. PETA euthanized this animal before their promised 5-day grace period, which you can fault them for. 

In the other incident, a PETA volunteer found a rough-looking dog wandering in an open field beside a highway. The volunteer removed the collar and brought the dog in for euthanasia. They were ultimately charged with theft of the dog's collar.

Those were the only incidents out of the 30 years they've been operating, yet CCF and company work the internet into believing that PETA are the puppy gestapo that go around every city in the US stealing dogs off of porches and shooting them on the sidewalk because they believe pet ownership is a form of slavery. 

The internet laps this up because it plays into peoples' confirmation bias that vegans are radical terrorists who want to steal your steak and shame you into oblivion because they adhere to the *absolutely totally extreme belief* that killing animals for pleasure is wrong. It's particularly bad on Reddit because of Reddit's many mechanisms for enforcing conformity and circlejerk behavior. Upvotes are basically a numerical indicator for how well your ideas conform to everyone else's, and each one gives you a little dopamine boost that encourages more conformity. Plus, it's easy for CCF and company to astroturf Reddit. Just make a post, buy upvotes and comments from a troll farm, and voila, you have yourself an idea conformity generator that's being seen by millions of young impressionable people. It's even better than a TV advertisement!

It's a curious [quirk of human psychology](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550611415695) that painting the messenger as a radical nutjob allows people to discard the message when the message is uncomfortable, particularly when that message is that you are wrong and need to change.

vegan,103,"I work at a restaurant, and this is true for a lot of cooked food in general. If you order anything fried, look on the menu to see if there are any other fried foods that are also in batter or a meat product (i.e. fish and chips entree or, like they said above, battered onion rings.) Battered products usually use both milk and eggs in it. If there are fried dishes that have animal products in it, chances are they use the same fryer for every dish because of space issues. To be fair, there are some restaurants that have fryers for specific purposes because of allergy reasons, so I would always ask if its an issue for you. 

Also, if you order say an impossible burger, it may be grilled on the same flat top as regular burgers. They do scrape the flat tops between orders, but 1) that doesn’t get rid of all the residue left over and 2) they could cook the impossible burger at the same time as regular burgers, so there is potential for your vegan burger to be adjacent to a meat burger. If this is an issue, you can always ask to have your burger cooked in a sauté pan.

When I was a server, I would always warn vegans about this. Some had issues with cross contamination and some did not. But I was very aware of it because I am a vegan myself. Some servers don’t even know the difference between vegetarians and vegans, so knowing which questions to ask is key :) ",0

vegan,103,"I'm not even a dog person and this story made me tear up.

My best friend has worked on multiple animal sanctuaries and one thing he's always said is that if anyone got to know animals the way he has, chickens, pigs, cows, they wouldn't eat them. They have personalities and grow attached to people the same as dogs and cats. It's a testament to your empathy that you made that connection.

There are lots of guides for new vegans. Spend a little time on Google to find the info that works for you.

Quick tips:

1. It's ok to eat a lot of ""fake"" meats and dairy early on. It's a transitional phase and whatever makes it easier for you is a good thing. If you're used to eating lots of meat, eat lots of fake meat early on. There's no reason to make the process harder on yourself. In particular, I enjoy Boca chicken patties, Beyond Burgers, and Benevolent Bacon. But you can try out things and figure out what your ""comfort"" food is.

2. In perfect circumstances, you can get every nutrient you need from plants, but some things are just easier to do with supplements. It's not a sign that vegan diets are deficient, just that it's more convenient to take a B12 or Omega 3 pill than to eat unwashed vegetables or dig up some seaweed or whatever. Lots of omnivores take supplements (or eat livestock supplemented with B12).

3. Don't beat yourself up over making small mistakes. You didn't realize your favorite bread had milk in it? Eh, no biggie. We've all accidentally eaten things we didn't realize had animal products in them. It's not about being perfect, it's about doing the best you can.",0

Decades later McDonald's patties tasted absolutely the same to me- it was a corporate truism that built their international business. A McD's burger is a McD's burger is a McD's burger, no matter whether in Singapore, Moscow or London. (though it wasn't exactly true, from what I've read.)

I guess this is a roundabout way of saying, considering these burgers are well done and uniform in texture and flavor, and considering how *good* some vegan burgers really are, they should ALL be plant-based!

The removal of YVFI was a complete injustice - whether you agree with some of r/vegan's policies or not. I am also resigning. 

Those of us who are leaving with him are doing it because we love him. YVFI is one of the kindest, and most genuine people i've ever had the pleasure to meet. To those of you who don't know him personally.. YVFI is a loving, kind, extremely intelligent, witty, clever, and *very* funny person. He has worked so hard on this community, dedicating time to things none has seen or recognized.. all in the name of saving animals, and spreading veganism. He loved every moment of it, and he loved r/vegan and this community more than any of us.  

Likewise, I am very saddened to have to step away from volunteering my time with this community; I have loved it. But I can not work under the manipulation of M4, who has completely mislead this community with their original post. And likewise, I can not work under Sylvan, who suddenly returned after a year of inactivity to piggyback on M4, and remove our appointed top moderator, over a situation that they didn't hear the active moderator's half of. But larger than both those issues - I can not work without YFVI. I only wish many of you could feel the love he radiates as a human being. He is a man worthy of more than he has ever been recognized for. The active r/vegan team loves him more than we can express. 

The months and months (and for DTV/YVFI.. over a year,) that many of us have put into this sub has been, exhausting. But its been worth it. I love so many of you, especially the wonderful Avocado community, and the other mods who are also stepping down in solidarity.

So Loki and Thor dress up like women and present themselves to the giant. He IMMEDIATELY falls in love with burlybabe Thor and marries him/her on the spot. “Lemme Show u my hammer, babeh,” Says giant. “I keep it under my pillow.” So the giant takes Thor to his bedroom and removes the pillow, revealing Thor’s hammer. (If you’re getting any themes of sexual discovery or revelation here then that’s on you and not me just sayin bro mkay ����‍♂️) 

Thor seizes his hammer, rips off his wig and dress and begins pounding the Giant (with the hammer). He kills the giant then kills all the other giants that lived there and then he and Loki go home.

PETA have been one of the more visible animal rights organizations over the years, and have historically been rather effective when it comes to exposing slaughterhouses, fur farms, circuses, and such. 
They do so through rather provocative means: think splashing models with red paint back in the '80s, putting up provocative billboards, holding fake dog barbecues, and, just recently, picking on Steve Irwin for harassing animals for entertainment on his show. This is what has triggered the latest internet shitstorm because his show was held in high regard by people who grew up with it. And though he has done quite a bit of conservation work and inspired people to care about animals, PETA does have a point. The show, if you've watched it, seems to be more about the spectacle of crocodile wrasslin' than anything else.

PETA's undercover footage has done more to get slaughterhouses to clean up their act than anything else. Dr. Temple Grandin, who has worked to improve slaughterhouse conditions for animals, has been quoted as saying that PETA did more with one ad campaign than what she did with 30 years of working with the industry (although I can't find it atm.) They've also been effective in changing peoples' minds and inspiring the vegan movement, which, though contained in the years before the internet, is exploding in popularity and threatening animal product producers' markets.

PETA is quite a threat to these enterprises, and they've responded by funding a thorough smear campaign against them. Places like ""petakillsanimals.com"", which is funded by the ""Center for Consumer Freedom"", a morally bankrupt organisation that lobbies the government on behalf of tobacco, alcohol, and fast and junk food manufacturers to do things like lobby against blood alcohol limits and cigarette taxes and smear organizations like MADD who support them.

Their biggest point usually draws from PETA's feral pet control and euthanasia programs. PETA takes in and euthanizes the 'hopeless cases' of animals which are suffering due to abuse or medical problems or are unadoptable due to behavioral problems. These are animals that ""no kill"" shelters reject and refuse to house. PETA takes the position that it is better for them to have a clean, merciful death than to suffer further. PETA also offers free euthanasia for pet owners who cannot afford a vet to do so.

PETA have euthanized about 30,000-40,000 animals over the 30+ years they have been operating. By comparison, humane societies, animal control, and other 'kill shelters' destroy about 2 million animals *per year.*

Think what you will about the ethics of running a 'kill shelter', but there's an unavoidable problem of the number of pet animals born into the world and not adopted by responsible people. There simply aren't infinite housing and care resources for a forever-expanding number of pets. The best solution would be for these animals never to be born in the first place, but not everyone does the responsible thing of neutering their pets, and people insist on having specially-bred pets, which requires breeders to produce far more than people can reasonably adopt.  

PKA harp on two incidents where PETA have killed animals which have belonged to people who did not want them killed. In one incident, they were called in to take care of a feral dog colony that occupied a trailer park and was harassing a farmer's cattle. Residents were given fair warning that all animals left outside and found without a collar or identification would be rounded up and euthanized. One animal did belong to someone: a chihuahua dog, which they lured away from someone's front porch with a treat. Again, this dog was without a collar or any form of identification. PETA euthanized this animal before their promised 5-day grace period, which you can fault them for. 

In the other incident, a PETA volunteer found a rough-looking dog wandering in an open field beside a highway. The volunteer removed the collar and brought the dog in for euthanasia. They were ultimately charged with theft of the dog's collar.

Those were the only incidents out of the 30 years they've been operating, yet CCF and company work the internet into believing that PETA are the puppy gestapo that go around every city in the US stealing dogs off of porches and shooting them on the sidewalk because they believe pet ownership is a form of slavery. 

The internet laps this up because it plays into peoples' confirmation bias that vegans are radical terrorists who want to steal your steak and shame you into oblivion because they adhere to the *absolutely totally extreme belief* that killing animals for pleasure is wrong. It's particularly bad on Reddit because of Reddit's many mechanisms for enforcing conformity and circlejerk behavior. Upvotes are basically a numerical indicator for how well your ideas conform to everyone else's, and each one gives you a little dopamine boost that encourages more conformity. Plus, it's easy for CCF and company to astroturf Reddit. Just make a post, buy upvotes and comments from a troll farm, and voila, you have yourself an idea conformity generator that's being seen by millions of young impressionable people. It's even better than a TV advertisement!

It's a curious [quirk of human psychology](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550611415695) that painting the messenger as a radical nutjob allows people to discard the message when the message is uncomfortable, particularly when that message is that you are wrong and need to change.

It's harder for me to find dehydrated daffodil tears. ",0
vegan,114,"&gt; You're not going to get anyone to stop eating meat by [insert whatever]

This whole, ""it's your fault omnivores eat animals"", is toxic as fuck and needs to end. Seriously.

vegan,114,Why do people willingly eat this?! They are so damn cute! ��,0
vegan,114,"&gt;It’s not even about the vegan/omni thing

You really cannot overstate this. This has literally almost nothing to do with the choice itself and everything to do with a massive lack of respect, like you said. Like, she could be making any change that she believes is positive, and his refusal to even TALK about it would be so fucking disrespectful. The line about “there wouldn’t have been a second date” from someone that they have two kids with is so unbelievably sad.",0
vegan,114,"I'm glad it got your attention, thank you! I think veganism is ideal for the poor especially in such countries where you can cut a lot from your budget by omitting meats and diary. It's better in all aspects. ",0

vegan,114,"I am really sad to see you go like this! You are one of the few older and founding mods that still remain in the moderation team that I always looked up to! Thank you for making this subreddit the welcoming space it is today, this place used to feel like family to me, and it doesn't anymore. It has changed a lot since, feels more corporate like and less personal today, but I do understand that it is a result of all the growth we have witnessed in recent years. I hope you get the recognition you deserve for all your contributions throughout these years, you efforts are appreciated &lt;3",0

vegan,114,"I've had two different mothers tell me that it's too complicated for them to be vegan because of their children. I, of course, tried to tell them that it wasn't difficult and was in each case verbally shut down. One said she plans on being vegan after her children are grown and leave home - meanwhile she isn't even vegetarian. ",0
vegan,114,"First and foremost, credit is due to u/Pro_Enjoyment &amp; u/SeverelyVegan for their eager initiative to format and provide this resource. My request for this was posted on r/VeganActivism \- which in my opinion will be the forefront of vegan activism on the internet in the near future. There's an accumulation of resources designed to make vegan activism simple, deliberate and perhaps most importantly, enjoyable.

[YouAreTheirVoice](https://youaretheirvoice.com/) was created and launched by [u/davidvanbeveren](https://www.reddit.com/user/davidvanbeveren). It's perhaps the most beautiful idea I've ever come across for vegan activism. They directly fund vegan activists on their mission for animal liberation. If you can, please consider making a donation for a few dollars a month. I promise you, there a few better causes to get involved in.

vegan,114,"So sorry you're going through this. It's incredibly painful to know how much harm your past has done, and how much harm those you love continue to contribute to.

We are told it's ok, from the beginning. I fully believe that if everyone saw Earthlings, the world would be mostly vegan. It's not that meat eaters are bad people, it's that they're uneducated. That includes you. If you would have truly known, you would have been vegan from birth. What's important is now you know and you can move forward with your life in peace.

We just learn to cope. Ignorance is bliss, and sometimes being enlightened is really hard. I won't walk past the meat section in grocery stores, I've been known to cry.

We know we're doing our part, and living as ethically as we can. Every time I make dinner for my friend and her family, I know I'm making a difference by replacing five meals (plus leftovers) that would otherwise contain meat.

Everytime I give a recipe for creamy avocado pasta sauce, hopefully they make it, and I've made a difference.

Be an advocate by being the healthiest, happiest vegan you can be. You DO make a difference, every single day.

Love and light &lt;3",0
