vegan,71,"Hello everyone,

This might be the last time I speak as a moderator of r/vegan, so let me offer my perspective.

I know many people disagreed with our policies and decisions. Trying to make this sub a welcoming place for all vegans while simultaneously using it as an activism tool spreading vegan ideology is not easy, and everybody has their own vision on how everything should function. It’s only natural that we can’t please every single person.

What I want you to know is that the amount of work required is enormous. We’ve been constantly dealing with spammers, trolls and coordinated raids. We’re talking hundreds of animal flesh pictures every single day, “bacon tho” comments and insults directed either at particular people, or vegan community in general. 

We had to assign shifts, we had to organize, we had to come up with policies and procedures to make this job possible. All of this just so the average user has no idea how much shit is going behind the scenes.

Why am I telling you this? Because I want you to know how important communication and being involved are. We didn’t press M4124124 and sylvan to be more active because we’re a bunch of meanies, we did that because if everyone would “just do their thing”, we would stand no chance against all the brigades. We needed to work as a team, and we needed to stay in touch with each other.

Making our internal affairs public is, in my opinion, highly unprofessional. On top of that, YVFI was demodded without warning or explanation, a decision I strongly disagree with. I can’t even explain to you how much time and effort this guy dedicated to r/vegan. He spent hundreds of hours dealing with mod queue, he created tools for other moderators to use, he recruited and trained new people, he was there to help, answer our questions, correct our mistakes, and make sure we’re fine. He didn’t do anything to deserve the treatment he received.

For all these reasons, I am stepping down as a r/vegan moderator. Huge thank you to everyone who contributed to this community, and good luck to those who decide to stay and anyone who comes to replace me.",2

vegan,283,"There's a common misconception that we need meat to be healthy, or at the very least, need meat to be muscular or strong. I believed that myself for a long time.

However, it is possible (and surprisingly easy) to get all your micronutrients from plants. It's also possible (and easy) to get any macronutrient breakdown (i.e. protein/carb/fat ratio) from plants as well. In other words, there is no need whatsoever to eat meat or dairy or eggs (for those of us living in the West, at least).

Every major nutritional organization agrees that properly planned vegan diets are safe and healthy for people at any stage of life, including pregnant women, babies, athletes, elderly, and everything in between!

* 1 cup VWG
* 3 tbsp all purpose flour
* 2 tbsp mushroom powder
* 1 ½ tsp salt
* 1 ½ tbsp maple syrup
* ½ tsp 5 spice
* ½ tsp black pepper
* 5 tbsp olive oil
* ½ cup water and 1 small to medium beet blended together

Knead together to form ball of dough (I instead blended everything together in the food processor, and I needed a few tbsp more VWG than it called for).
Coat the outside with a mixture of beefless seasoning, peppercorns/pickling spice, and chili flakes. Wrap with plastic wrap and let sit for several hours – a day. 

Make the broth for cooking.

* 5 cups water
* 2 bay leaves
* 4 -5 cloves garlic smashed
* 2 -3 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp salt
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp mustard seeds
* 1 ½ tsp all spice berries
* 1 tbsp jerk seasoning
* 1 tbsp beefless seasoning

Bring broth to a boil and then simmer on low heat. Wrap seitan in a cheesecloth, add to broth and cook covered for 30 mins. Then into a 275 F oven covered for 1 ½ hours. (I wrapped the seitan tighter in the cheesecloth than Connie did but I should have done another layer or two and pulled it even tighter because the outside got a little spongey. Or maybe I'll try foil wrapped next time?)

Add seitan to a hot oiled pan. Drizzle with maple syrup and mustard, sprinkle with black pepper and add a few drops of liquid smoke. Flip and repeat with the other side. (I did this twice for either side)

* 1 cup VWG

* 2 tbsp mushroom powder
* 1 ½ tsp salt
* 1 ½ tbsp maple syrup
* ½ tsp 5 spice
* ½ tsp black pepper
* 5 tbsp olive oil
* ½ cup water and 1 small to medium beet blended together

Knead together to form ball of dough (I instead blended everything together in the food processor, and I needed a few tbsp more VWG than it called for).
Coat the outside with a mixture of beefless seasoning, peppercorns/pickling spice, and chili flakes. Wrap with plastic wrap and let sit for several hours – a day.

* 2 bay leaves
* 4 -5 cloves garlic smashed
* 2 -3 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp salt
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp mustard seeds
* 1 ½ tsp all spice berries
* 1 tbsp jerk seasoning
* 1 tbsp beefless seasoning

That being said I have actually had raw chocolate made from unfermented cacao in Venezuela. But I am a professional in the industry and no one is selling that to consumers. 

I think there are unfortunately a lot of anti-science people in the vegan movement. I follow a vegan parenting and pregnancy page on Instagram, and the amount of likes anti-vax comments get on that page are disturbing. ",0

vegan,423,"Disclaimer: My massive weight loss wasn’t directly attributed to veganism.  But I attribute veganism to the fact that I havent gotten back to being severely obese or diabetic again.  I had diabetes almost requiring the use of insulin. I was taking medication for diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and I was only 29 when I had to begin consulting a nephrologist because it appeared I may have had the beginnings of kidney disease. 

A year after the weight loss, I started seeing my weight progressively getting higher, and my blood sugar and blood pressure starting going back up as well.  Going vegan helped me bring those numbers back down and will help me keep them down for the rest of my life.  I want to make sure I’ll be able to see my kids grow up.  Going vegan is the best insurance policy I could give myself.

EDIT: My blood sugar is actually typically in the low 90s.  This was the only picture I found though. I don’t have my glucometer anymore. Gave it and my diabetic supplies to someone else who needed it more.

EDIT2:  Failed to mention one more thing - I have had all my prescriptions discontinued. EVERYTHING is considered “resolved” (diabetes, hypertension, hyoercholesterolemia, poor kidney function, and sleep apnea all resolved.  Also since going vegan and dairy-free, my eczema and psoriasis has dramatically improved.  My eczema used to be so bad I’d attempt to wear foundation to hide the stark redness).

EDIT3:  Can’t believe how fast this post got. Thank you to everyone!!! If a moderator sees this, can I get a “vegan nurse” title?

EDIT4:  Clarification - my diet wasn’t STRICTLY meat before. Word choice was poor. But it was definitely little to zero vegetables. And very little fruit. Hated vegetables and avoided them as much as I could. I’m still learning to enjoy some of them but my intake is definitely 20-30x more fruits and vegetables than what I took in before. I previously was, as my wife described it, a garbage disposal.  I just ate everything in site that wasn’t fruits or vegetables.  After I lost the weight from a gastric sleeve bariatric surgery and saw everything I had worked for creeping back up again (high BP, FSBS going up, WEIGHT was going back up fast) I knew I had to do something. I was tired of doing the same thing over and over again - yo-yo dieting.  I’ve done the low carb thing (for a long time actually since I was diabetic, I ALWAYS felt deprived).  I’ve done juicing. I’ve done weight watchers.  I decided to just try a vegan diet. Just one day, cold turkey, I stopped eating meat, dairy, and eggs.  Told myself “I’ll just do this for 7 days”.  Well, 7 days past and I never stopped.  I just felt better and I kept going.  Weight stabilized and went back down. Blood pressure went back to normal. FSBS went back to normal. Skin cleared up way more times than it did before. Energy felt more stable.  It’s this way of living for everyone? I don’t know. I just know it works for me.   I kept going, learned more about CAFOs and the environmental impact of the industry.  Those other reasons are now whether tethers me to continue this.  I don’t know what I’ll be doing a year or so from now but at this point I CANNOT even picture myself going back to eating meat - this guy, the one who BBQ’d like crazy, the one who would watch family kill a pig to cook LECHON, the guy who was way more excited than he should have been for the DOUBLE-DOWN chicken sandwich from KFC, the guy whose favorite oil to cook with was bacon oil.  Something had to change and I made my change.  If someone, ANYONE, may be experience what I experience whether bariatric pre-op or post-op, I felt it was worth sharing.  Surgery was just a way for me to start from the beginning again.  

It doesn’t matter if you can reset the game, you can still screw up a game save if you keep making the same wrong decisions.  I just decided to make different ones. Now I’m further along in the game than I ever been.

[Ingredients]

For the ""crab"":
~0.67 lbs Laetiporus cincinnatus mushroom, hand shredded
~1.5 nori sheets
~5 strands saffron
~1 tbsp sugar
~1 tbsp salt
~1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning

The rest of the ""crab"" cake ingredients:
~1 cup panko bread crumbs
~0.5 cup vegan mayo
~1 cup red pepper, small dice
~1 cup scallion, chopped
~0.5 cup cilantro, chopped
~1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning
~1 tbsp dried thyme leaves
~1 Tsp salt
~1 Tsp cracked black pepper
~1 Tsp cayenne pepper

For the light batter for the outside of the cakes:
~0.33 cup corn starch
~0.33 cup self rising flour
~add small increments of water until it forms a thin batter

[Directions]

Bring the water, saffron, nori/seaweed/kelp, Old Bay, salt and sugar to a boil, remove from heat, strain and keep all liquid.
Boil the Laetiporus cincinnatus in the reserved liquid for at least 7 minutes. Strain, and chill in the fridge.

Once chilled, add the ""crab"" and all of the other ingredients (except the batter) to a bowl, and mix. Let the ""crab"" cake mixture sit covered in the fridge for at least an hour (for best results, do this the day before cooking them).

Once the mixture has sat in the fridge for at least an hour, form into cakes. I used a 0.25 cup measuring cup to portion out cakes for forming. Once all of the cakes are portioned (should be between 8 and 10 cakes, I made 9), get your vegetable oil to 350 F, dip your cakes in your batter, and fry until golden brown on each side.",0

They try to get their fruits and veggies in but still have a pint of ice cream in the freezer. They try to get regular exercise, but have trouble committing to a plan because they’re so busy at work.

vegan,91,"It is with great sadness that I too will be stepping down as a moderator here on r/vegan. I have moderated here for over a year and appreciate the community support that got me here in the first place. Special thank you to amazing community member u/Elzibet who nominated me in the beginning. 

I simply cannot stay on the team after the unfair removal of YVFI. I have given my all here and spent many hours guarding the community from “meat” pics, “bacon tho” comments and everything else that is thrown our way. 

I would like to take this opportunity to clarify I had **zero** knowledge of M4’s disabilities before that public post. If that had been shared privately, everything would have been different. 

I am sad to leave, but here are my suggestions for those staying: 

* As you work to refine the shadowban policy, be aware that shadowbanned submissions or comments do not go the queue. Creating extra work is *not* one of the downsides of shadowbanning. Make sure the community is aware of this as the policy is discussed as they were told misinformation about how it works earlier this week.

* Consider clarifying for users in M4’s thread that many were *not* shadowbanned, despite being told so. Comments needing approval is not equivalent to a shadowban. Some users just had comments filtered for other reasons. Multiple users who have had comments filtered for further review are messaging the mods thinking they are shadowbanned.  

* From M4’s post it is clear the community has been unhappy with some of the moderating policies. Start a monthly thread where the community can give feedback and the moderator’s can be more transparent about current policy discussion. 

* Create a policy on the mod team about handling conflict. Make sure the policy clearly states that it should be handled **privately** (i.e. internal). It does no good for the community for the mod’s grievances with one another to be aired publicly. Ultimately we are just forfeiting opportunities to help non-human animals every time a post about the mods takes up significant space on our page.",2
vegan,161,Peter Singer holds a similar viewpoint. In Animal Liberation he makes a point that he doesn’t particularly care for animals at all - just that it’s wrong to exploit them,0
vegan,1,"u/YourVeganFallacyIs was the technical and operations core of r/vegan. I've known of their enthusiastic vegan advocacy here on r/vegan for years even before I started actively posting here. Their dedication to veganism and to the quality of the community is plainly evidenced by their history and by the messages of support they have received from this post. 

&amp;nbsp;

Their appointment as moderator over a year ago along with u/DreamTeamVegan helped guide [r/vegan through 2018 to where it is now, doubling the subscriber count](https://subredditstats.com/r/vegan). For most of 2018, only 2 active moderators, YVFI and DTV, handled the management and operations of the subreddit. They were left on their own by the inactive 'old' moderators, alone to implement technical solutions and resources for communication, change management, automation, documentation and operations. I heard they also occasionally slept and ate.

&amp;nbsp;

As the subreddit grew, additional moderators u/AllieLikesReddit and u/CharlieAndArtemis joined and by this time backend policies and training had been developed and implemented to help new moderators get up to speed with efficient unified moderation practices. The documentation and training was handled almost exclusively by u/YourVeganFallacyIs. Training extended to hour long video conferencing and screen sharing where every click and keystroke was explicitly defined and explained to help every moderator perform with aptitude and efficiency.

&amp;nbsp;

When I started participating in auxiliary team duties at the start of this year, it took me 2 weeks to read back the volume of moderator policy discussion from the previous year. To the general subscriber or visitor here, you have no idea how many hundreds of hours of internal debate and discussion went into every little change or potential change. Everything was reasoned rationally. Everything was documented. Everything was evaluated for impact and risk. All decisions and changes were done so by the active team members together - no one single person held power. Every team member was invited to participate. But if team members don't show up, don't reply to mail, don't engage in active moderation at all, there simply is no choice but to get on with the job of managing the subreddit without them. That's the reality of running a busy public facing endeavour like this subreddit. 

&amp;nbsp;

Every active moderator was either on duty or on call perhaps 10 - 12 hours a day for every single day of the week striving to provide round the clock coverage to the subreddit community. The level of personal dedication and sacrifice by the active moderation team was astonishing because from the outside, noone would have a clue. It was not an ego trip, it was a love and a duty to help in some small way a vegan community and by extension, veganism.

&amp;nbsp;

The active moderator majority had been functioning brilliantly for months with a level of professionalism you would expect more from a company than a group of volunteers teleconferencing from all over the world. If you were a moderator, you were expected to show up each day for 'work' for whatever period you can spare in service of this community. If you were absent, you were expected to communicate that unavailability to the team so that your shift could be covered so as to not impact the quality of service the public subreddit users enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;

So what's gone wrong? 

Why are we here telling you this? 

Reddit moderator hierarchy is an authoritarian system dictated by seniority rather than merit or democracy. Top moderator holds absolute power. Power to dismiss all other moderators below unquestioned or opposed. A rush of blood to the head from a brand new inexperienced 'leader' thrust into power unexpectedly resulted in the unannounced, unsupported, unilateral dismissal of arguably the most technically vital and experienced team member. A 'leader' with no respect, knowledge or understanding of general change management practice, let alone the very detailed and specific change management in place and worked for by the active moderation team. Further personal sentiment of the disastrous consequences of this persons actions cannot be expressed professionally but you can imagine if the majority of your active working team walk out on the new boss, there is a reason.

&amp;nbsp;

But fear not. There are still active moderators and there will no doubt be new active moderators. Veganism grows stronger and the subreddit will continue to grow. All this is minor transient fluff in the grand scheme of life.

That's a show animal that's been meticulously groomed so that backwards old fucks like my dad can poke and ogle at their butts and loins and fantasize about how much money they'll make at slaughter and whether they should make the poor thing's parents fuck again.

I used to show lambs. The things we did and that other showmen do are nothing short of abuse. Chaining them to tables for hours at a time, dragging them by their heads to ""break"" them so they'll handle for show, bottle feeding and drenching and starving them to get rid of their perfectly normal 'hay gut' so they'll look like one great big flexed bicep on legs.

Then, if they're lucky, and a dude thinks they have the nicest looking butt, they're drug into an auction pit, ogled at some more, and bid upon like slaves. Big shots will then run each other up to make themselves 'stand out' in the community and earn a reputation for being 'friendly to our local farmers'. 

That's all it's for, 'cause the animal's carcass tastes like shit. You think that after all the 'training' and nutritional abuse the creature suffers to get showy 'fake tits' for muscles that they're going to taste good? No! They're lean, they're stringy, they're gray, and they taste nothing like animal that's been allowed to eat what it wants, wander where it likes, and lay down whenever it wants to and have a peaceful life.

Not to mention that without the wool and with all the grease washed out of their skin, they're open to fungal infections, biting flies, and injuries from rubbing against things in their enclosures. It's such a problem that we have to put drugs and pesticides and blankets on them to keep it from happening.

Take what you know about bodybuilding and what bodybuilders do for shows (drugs included, sometimes), then have a sadistic circus trainer that calls himself a farmer do it to a scared young animal that did nothing worse than have a nice-looking butt. ***That's*** how you get what's on the left.

vegan,162,"yea I'm really not a fan of the fact that veganism is getting increasingly co-opted to be a consumer identity - it's yet another case of capitalist recuperation declawing a radical movement into something that is profitable. It's reducing the situation to a dichotomy of two competing consumer identities - ""vegan"" and ""meat eater"". The two sides are effectively in what amounts to a sort of war - and since it is a consumer identity the way of ""winning"" this war is to consume more of the ""right"" things - to buy more vegan stuff, including vegan merch, vegan mugs, vegan t-shirts or on the flipside, meat, as well as anti-vegan mugs and t-shirts. This allows capitalists to sell ""weapons"" to both sides - selling ammunition to vegans to attack meat eaters with while at the same time selling ammunition to anti-vegans to do the reverse. Suddenly, instead of fighting those that actually have the power that they use to exploit humans and animals alike, we're fighting eachother and the movement is rendered harmless to the capitalists, including the meat industry.

Veganism should not just be a diet, it shouldn't just be a consumer choice, it's about reducing and ultimately ending the exploitation of animals. Reducing and eliminating your own personal consumption of animal products is just a part of this. A necessary part, yes, but don't mistake consuming the right shit for some kind of radical activism that's going to bring about an end to exploitation.",1

Calves born to dairy cows are torn from their mothers within hours of birth, in order for humans to steal the milk intended for them. Male calves are sold to auction to be slaughtered for veal or cheap beef, while female calves are typically raised in “calf hutches,” little plastic igloos or dog-house-type structures with a few feet of fenced in dirt in front. They live this way, in complete isolation, for the first 2 to 3 months of their lives. They do not leave the hutches to run or play, and in order to prevent the possibility of young calves spreading sickness amongst themselves (a potential profit loss), they are not even allowed to touch each other. This, during the time when they are most in need of touch, most of all from their own mothers, with whom they would normally be grazing, nuzzling, and experiencing the greatest bond any mammal ever knows.

I spent a week at a dairy farm that has taken ethical arguments against dairy extremely seriously and is trying to forge a path in ethical dairying. It is slaughter-free (they keep all their bulls and their older cows), calves are kept with their mothers except at milking time, cows are milked once per day to minimize stress, they feed on grass, and they picked heritage breeds for their programs that are healthy, live long, but produce less milk. It impressed upon me two things: 1) that this approach could not possibly scale (they produced basically enough to keep themselves afloat and didn’t really send their products outside of the local foodshed), and 2) that this happy little farm I was at was the image that people, including me at the time, have when looking at the packaging of organic/grassfed/etc dairy, but that it could not possibly be the reality 99.99% of the time.

Jonathan Safran Foer on PETA from Eating Animals:

&gt;Whatever one thinks of them, no organization strikes fear in the factory farm industry and its allies more than PETA. They are effective. When PETA targeted fast-food companies, the most famous and powerful welfare scientist in the country, Temple Grandin (who has designed more than half the cattle slaughter facilities in the nation), said she saw more improvement in welfare in one year than she had seen in her entire thirty-year career previously. Arguably the biggest PETA hater on the planet, Steve Kopperud (a meat industry consultant who has given anti-PETA seminars for a decade), puts it this way: “There’s enough understanding in the industry now of what PETA’s capable of to put the fear of God into many executives.” It didn’t surprise me to learn that companies of all kinds regularly negotiate with PETA and quietly make changes in their animal welfare policies to avoid being publicly targeted by the group.

Edit: Here's PETA's [official statement](https://www.peta.org/blog/euthanize/) on why they euthanize so many animals, as there seems to be a lot of misinformation.",0

vegan,154,"Yeah. Free-range just means “no individual cages” (so they cram them all into one big cage instead) and *hypothetical* “access to the outdoors” (which in practice is just a door along the wall leading to a tiny outdoor pen that is only opened a few weeks before slaughter, essentially guaranteeing that the chickens, terrified of new environments, will never see the sunlight). 

That said, some studies have found that most supermarket eggs labeled “free-range” are actually layed by caged chickens; an egg farm with two caged sheds and one not can market *all* its eggs as “free-range.”

It’s all a sick marketing game. The truth is in what they leave out.

vegan,191,"I thought beekeeping was ""helpful"" to the bee problem, too. Turns out, beekeeping is a (possibly major) contributing factor into why we have this problem in the first place. Beekeepers bring non-native bees into new areas, where they compete with the local bee populations, causing die offs. The beekept populations tend to be very genetically undiverse (sourced from the same strains) and are therefore much more susceptible to die offs themselves due to disease, etc.

All that aside, bees make honey for themselves, not us. We take their life's work (3 bees life's work = 1/4 teaspoon of honey), and replace it with an inferior substitute, causing further health issues. The queen's wings are frequently clipped to prevent her from leaving, and many beekeepers find it more ""economically viable"" to let the entire hive die off over the winter in colder climates, and just buy new bees in the spring.

If we really care about bee survival, we need to stop fucking with them and stealing their food.",0

I made an attempt to try vegetarianism at 21 years old. My sister had been a vegan for YEARS and opened up to me about how sad she was that she didn’t have any veggie/vegan friends to share her thoughts and experiences with. Prior to that, I was a typical Omni...Meats, cheeses, only ate veggies/fruits to have a balanced diet. I teased my sister about her diet and lifestyle like most A-holes do. But, I did it. I gave up meat. I did it cold turkey. Meat was easy. It took me 8 months to swap to veganism, but I haven’t looked back since. I beat myself up for not doing it sooner. I am in love with how I look and feel. There’s been periods of my life where I feel infinitely stronger and faster than when I had an omnivore diet.

I have been in the Air Force 7 years, so I have been spreading the word for a long time. I get a lot of flak for my diet and lifestyle. Which is okay, because I kick ass on my PT Tests and am constantly probably one of the most fit people in the unit. The reason I point out being in the military is that I have been able to have a handful of people try vegetarianism and veganism just because they know someone who lives the life. I do my best to maintain a vegan lifestyle when I am deployed and overseas. It has only gotten easier as time goes on. 

Just trying my best to be a vegan advocate in an environment where people often ridicule us. An advocate for the people who think they can’t sustain the diet or lifestyle. Thank you for the support. I am so happy I found this sub on reddit. Love y’all. ������

I didn’t choose my diet until my 95th year. I was given the standard American diet at birth and adopted it like everyone else. I spent 90 plus years eating meat for protein and drinking milk for strong bones and didn’t question it until I watched What The Health. 

In the documentary I was exposed to the the extremely negative health, environmental and ethical impacts of animal agriculture and I CHOSE VEGAN. Do I wish I found this information sooner? Yes. But once I got it, I made the change and now i’m passionate about spreading the truth: We do not need to consume animal products to survive therefore we have no right to kill another sentient being and contribute to the destruction of our planet in the process.

vegan,397,"Disclaimer: My massive weight loss wasn’t directly attributed to veganism.  But I attribute veganism to the fact that I havent gotten back to being severely obese or diabetic again.  I had diabetes almost requiring the use of insulin. I was taking medication for diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and I was only 29 when I had to begin consulting a nephrologist because it appeared I may have had the beginnings of kidney disease. 

A year after the weight loss, I started seeing my weight progressively getting higher, and my blood sugar and blood pressure starting going back up as well.  Going vegan helped me bring those numbers back down and will help me keep them down for the rest of my life.  I want to make sure I’ll be able to see my kids grow up.  Going vegan is the best insurance policy I could give myself.

EDIT: My blood sugar is actually typically in the low 90s.  This was the only picture I found though. I don’t have my glucometer anymore. Gave it and my diabetic supplies to someone else who needed it more.

EDIT2:  Failed to mention one more thing - I have had all my prescriptions discontinued. EVERYTHING is considered “resolved” (diabetes, hypertension, hyoercholesterolemia, poor kidney function, and sleep apnea all resolved.  Also since going vegan and dairy-free, my eczema and psoriasis has dramatically improved.  My eczema used to be so bad I’d attempt to wear foundation to hide the stark redness).

EDIT3:  Can’t believe how fast this post got. Thank you to everyone!!! If a moderator sees this, can I get a “vegan nurse” title?

EDIT4:  Clarification - my diet wasn’t STRICTLY meat before. Word choice was poor. But it was definitely little to zero vegetables. And very little fruit. Hated vegetables and avoided them as much as I could. I’m still learning to enjoy some of them but my intake is definitely 20-30x more fruits and vegetables than what I took in before. I previously was, as my wife described it, a garbage disposal.  I just ate everything in site that wasn’t fruits or vegetables.  After I lost the weight and saw it creeping back up again, I knew I had to do something. I was tired of doing the same thing over and over again - yo-yo dieting.  I decided to just try a vegan diet. Just one day, cold turkey, I stopped eating meat, dairy, and eggs.  Told myself “I’ll just do this for 7 days”.  Well, 7 days past and I never stopped.  I just felt better and I kept going.  Weight stabilized and went back down. Blood pressure went back to normal. FSBS went back to normal. Skin cleared up way more times than it did before. Energy felt more stable.  It’s this way of living for everyone? I don’t know. I just know it works for me.   I kept going, learned more about CAFOs and the environmental impact of the industry.  Those other reasons are now whether tethers me to continue this.  I don’t know what I’ll be doing a year or so from now but at this point I CANNOT even picture myself going back to eating meat - this guy, the one who BBQ’d like crazy, the one who would watch family kill a pig to cook LECHON, the guy who was way more excited than he should have been for the DOUBLE-DOWN chicken sandwich from KFC, the guy whose favorite oil to cook with was bacon oil.  Something had to change and I made my change.  If someone, ANYONE, may be experience what I experience whether bariatric pre-op or post-op, I felt it was worth sharing.  Surgery was just a way for me to start from the beginning again.  

It doesn’t matter if you can reset the game, you can still screw up a game save if you keep making the same wrong decisions.  I just decided to make different ones. Now I’m further along in the game than I ever been.",0
vegan,499,"Relevant paper:

&gt;Many people like eating meat, but most are reluctant to harm things that have minds. The current three studies show that this dissonance motivates people to deny minds to animals. Study 1 demonstrates that animals considered appropriate for human consumption are ascribed diminished mental capacities. Study 2 shows that meat eaters are motivated to deny minds to food animals when they are reminded of the link between meat and animal suffering. Finally, Study 3 provides direct support for our dissonance hypothesis, showing that expectations regarding the immediate consumption of meat increase mind denial. Moreover, this mind denial in turn reduces negative affect associated with dissonance. The findings highlight the role of dissonance reduction in facilitating the practice of meat eating and protecting cultural commitments.

Here is a recipe for my family's favourite mac and cheese. It's a one pot dish that is sure to please everyone in your household.

When our first born Son was a toddler, we noticed he had difficulties digesting certain foods. After a family picnic to the Reginald Memorial Park, where I packed a delicious lunch of sushi burritos and seaweed salad [recipe here], he developed a serious case of flatulence. Like concerned parents, DH and I quickly went to Instagram to find remedies. It was on Instagram that we came across Spirit Naturals, a homeopathic medicine company based out of Boulder, Colorado.

Spirit Naturals produces many homeopathic remedies for children and they also sell many other health items every family needs: crystals, essential oils, Mongolian medicine spoons, and our favourite--- TootToot Tummies for kids!

TootToot Tummies are an all natural ginger based vegan gummy for children. It helps to promote and regulate healthy gut flora and a healthy gut biome. Use code SNAKEOIL15 on your next purchase when use the link down below!

Unless you have extremely severe epilepsy like the people it was originally invented for, I see no reason to pursue a keto diet in the first place, though a version that avoided unnecessarily animal suffering would obviously be a huge improvement.

Anyway, the point of my comment is moreso that nobody seems to question promoters of fad diets like keto, paleo, and whole 30 that promote heavy amounts of animal products over the fact that their diets (as typically presented and advertised) are outside of many people's budgets.

 It's all fucked. So many people quit the first day, even avid hunters who had no idea how different it would be when you're face-to-face, looking individuals in the eye before you have to kill them.

&gt; Livestock accounts for an estimated 9% of global carbon dioxide emissions, 35-40% of global methane emissions, and 65% of nitrous oxide emissions. ^[[source]](http://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e00.htm)
 
&gt; **Livestock animals emissions makeup anywhere between 14.5-18% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Comparably, the transportation sector (all cars, trucks, boats, ships and airplanes combined) is responsible for around 14% of emissions.**
  
&gt; **Methane gas is one of the largest contributors to global warming and can trap up to 100 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a five-year period.** All of this gas then enters our atmosphere. ^[[source]](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/)

&gt; **90% of rainforest deforestation is due to animal agriculture.**   

So every time we buy a beef burger or something with pork from the supermarket or a fast food like Wendy's, McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, Burger King and others, we contribuite to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and to the planet destruction your and my children will probably can't enjoy like we did.

**Other Environmental Damage Caused by Animal Agriculture:**

* habitat loss
* biodiversity loss
* ecosystem damage &amp; destruction
* growth of pathogenic organisms
* rangeland degradation
* topsoil erosion
* global warming
* formation of noxious oxide
* ammonia emissions
* wildlife killed by gov and farm operators
* spreading of nitrates in groundwater
* crop contamination
* groundwater contamination
* release of methane

And no, this is not the fault of government, 100 companies or the richest people in the world. 

This is our fault as consumers for paying for animal products. Supply and demand.

vegan,389,"Since this is about to get a lot of attention and we may get some r/all participants in this thread, let me lay out and address some of the arguments for hunting:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Hunting is natural and sustainable.*

Humans and the livestock we raise make up 96% of mammal biomass on earth \[[Source](https://www.ecowatch.com/biomass-humans-animals-2571413930.html)\]. Wild mammals make up 4%. There is no sustainable way to bring meat to the table to 8 billion people without factory farming, which is itself massively unsustainable in a multitude of other ways. If the world hunted for their food, we would have no wild mammals left in a matter of months. Hunting is ""sustainable"" because so few people actually hunt for their meat.

Take deer for example. North America has roughly 40 million deer \[[Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiki5nZvP_fAhVyh-AKHUfeDdQQFjABegQIARAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrophiccascades.forestry.oregonstate.edu%2Fsites%2Ftrophic%2Ffiles%2FCrete%25201999.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2kcxJM-zlkDDHBQOqx1Mg-)\]. How long do you think that would sustain the population of North America, which is nearing 600 million people and growing? Hunting is not anywhere near a solution for feeding the world. The last time humans primarily hunted for their diet (before 8000 BCE), the global human population was on the order of 1-2 million \[[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_estimates)\]. And even then, humans **frequently** hunted large species of mammals to extinction.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Hunting license fees go directly toward forest and wildlife management and conservation.*

If they cared about forest and wildlife management, hunters would donate this money instead or be in favor of raising taxes to fund those organizations. Hunters just want to hunt. I can think of no more a hypocritical way to ""enjoy and preserve the outdoors"" than enacting my violence upon it for no other good reason than ""I like to hunt."" Most hunters live within a stone's throw of a grocery store.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Hunting keeps pest population in check.*

This is correct to a degree. Natural predators do this much better than we can ever hope to achieve. Pest populations can often become out of control in suburban areas. This has become a frequent issue in areas of the southeast United States for no other reason than we eliminated their natural predators. Take Yellowstone National Park for example: when wolves were reintroduced to the park after being hunted out, it brought an ecological balance and solved issues that had plagued the park for decades \[[Source](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140128-how-wolves-saved-a-famous-park)\]. 

The primary reason for eliminating these natural predators is to protect our livestock. Rabbit populations plague farmers when predators like foxes and weasels are hunted out of the area to protect chickens and other fowl. Animal agriculture has caused this ""need"" for humans to perform population control through hunting, and everything about the cycle is a result of us enforcing our human will on the natural world in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*I enjoy being in nature and the thrill of hunting.*

Then I have an awesome new hobby for you hunters: **wildlife photography**. It captures the same essence of hunting, minus the violence. You get a ""trophy"" in the form of pictures you take. It requires patience and extended time spent in a natural setting. As far as I know, there are no restrictions on taking photos of any species at any time of the year, unlike hunting. Photographing a deer well is going to be much more of a challenge than shooting it.

The removal of YVFI was a complete injustice - whether you agree with some of r/vegan's policies or not. I am also resigning. 

Those of us who are leaving with him are doing it because we love him. YVFI is one of the kindest, and most genuine people i've ever had the pleasure to meet. To those of you who don't know him personally.. YVFI is a loving, kind, extremely intelligent, witty, clever, and *very* funny person. He has worked so hard on this community, dedicating time to things none has seen or recognized.. all in the name of saving animals, and spreading veganism. He loved every moment of it, and he loved r/vegan and this community more than any of us.  

Likewise, I am very saddened to have to step away from volunteering my time with this community; I have loved it. But I can not work under the manipulation of M4, who has completely mislead this community with their original post. And likewise, I can not work under Sylvan, who suddenly returned after a year of inactivity to piggyback on M4, and remove our appointed top moderator, over a situation that they didn't hear the active moderator's half of. But larger than both those issues - I can not work without YFVI. I only wish many of you could feel the love he radiates as a human being. He is a man worthy of more than he has ever been recognized for. The active r/vegan team loves him more than we can express. 

The months and months (and for DTV/YVFI.. over a year,) that many of us have put into this sub has been, exhausting. But its been worth it. I love so many of you, especially the wonderful Avocado community, and the other mods who are also stepping down in solidarity.

vegan,159,"tl;dr: I don't hunt or eat meat, but OP is straw manning hunters. Vegans don't like constantly dealing with poorly-reasoned objections, so the least that can be done is not doing the same to others.

&gt; Humans and the livestock we raise make up 96% of mammal biomass on earth \[[Source](https://www.ecowatch.com/biomass-humans-animals-2571413930.html)\]. Wild mammals make up 4%. There is no sustainable way to bring meat to the table to 8 billion people without factory farming, which is itself massively unsustainable in a multitude of other ways. If the world hunted for their food, we would have no wild mammals left in a matter of months. Hunting is ""sustainable"" because so few people actually hunt for their meat.

I've never seen a hunter claim everyone could or should move to eating hunted meat, so this is a straw man. The individuals who do eat what they shoot can offset their factory-farmed meats, and as the wild animals are a net gain for the environment, their marginal contribution to the degradation of the planet is smaller than someone who eats just as much meat from factory farming + plastic packaging.

You could make the same argument for a ton of vegan foods that would be tough if everyone consumed them or tried to scale, but are still *better* as-is. Looking at you, water-greedy almond milk, meat substitutes, and low-scale organic farming (nice veggies can be crazy expensive).

&gt; If they cared about forest and wildlife management, hunters would donate this money instead or be in favor of raising taxes to fund those organizations. Hunters just want to hunt. I can think of no more a hypocritical way to ""enjoy and preserve the outdoors"" than enacting my violence upon it for no other good reason than ""I like to hunt."" Most hunters live within a stone's throw of a grocery store.

If vegans cared about animals and the environment, they'd never, ever use any plastic, right?

It's possible to be 1) imperfect but better and 2) do two things. Tons of hunters *are also hikers*, go backpacking, buy park passes, etc. A ton of them are also environmentalists. In fact, they can be the primary environmentalist contingent in rural (and generally conservative) states/provinces.

And your premise is still false: if parks get hunters' money, they get hunters' money, even if it doesn't pass your purity test.

&gt; This is correct to a degree. Natural predators do this much better than we can ever hope to achieve. Pest populations can often become out of control in suburban areas. This has become a frequent issue in areas of the southeast United States for no other reason than we eliminated their natural predators. Take Yellowstone National Park for example: when wolves were reintroduced to the park after being hunted out, it brought an ecological balance and solved issues that had plagued the park for decades \[[Source](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140128-how-wolves-saved-a-famous-park)\]. 

Yellowstone didn't allow hunters in the areas affected, so you're comparing apples to oranges.

It's not like hunters are just making up wild animals suffering in the winter / becoming overpopulated. Even if one were to grant that other predators are more effective ecologically, it won't change the fact that in prime hunting areas, the same population of deer will face these deaths: seconds to minutes via bullet, minutes to hours via bows or predators (this is why bow hunting is straight-up unethical, full stop), hours to days to weeks starving and freezing in the winter. The environment has a carrying capacity and deer aren't exactly planning their procreation habits based on it.

I think OP might be trying to make understated points that assume a claim that hunting is necessary and there are no alternatives, but I've yet to see hunters make that claim, either.

&gt; The primary reason for eliminating these natural predators is to protect our livestock. Rabbit populations plague farmers when predators like foxes and weasels are hunted out of the area to protect chickens and other fowl. Animal agriculture has caused this ""need"" for humans to perform population control through hunting, and everything about the cycle is a result of us enforcing our human will on the natural world in the first place.

This is a good point - predators (et al) get shot by ranchers and other folks that maintain livestock and if we stopped raising livestock the predators might (might) recover. I'm not sure why this is hunters' problem in particular, as they are, again, offsetting their consumption of livestock.

&gt; Then I have an awesome new hobby for you hunters: **wildlife photography**. It captures the same essence of hunting, minus the violence. You get a ""trophy"" in the form of pictures you take. It requires patience and extended time spent in a natural setting. As far as I know, there are no restrictions on taking photos of any species at any time of the year, unlike hunting. Photographing a deer well is going to be much more of a challenge than shooting it.

They are not the same. Someone who enjoys hunting won't be wowed by this argument at all, and again, hunters are already outdoorsy.

&gt; There is no reason to hunt as a non-indigenous human who takes advantage of all the luxuries of the 1st world.

There are thousands of deer dying slowly and painfully every winter and your dad wants to spend some time bonding and the way he did that with his dad is hunting. You go and provide a comparatively humane death to an animal who lived a much better life than a factory-farmed animal. 

Seems like a better deal than, ""let them die slowly and painfully so I can feel righteous in all ways"".",0

Or seen an animal fighting to escape, screaming, crying for mercy, and still having to do it. Being halfway down the line where you're supposed to skin a dead animal but the stun didn't work this time so the throat cutter couldn't get a good cut and it's still very much alive but the line doesn't stop, not for anything, it's still your job and you do it or you're fired.
 It's all fucked. So many people quit the first day, even avid hunters who had no idea how different it would be when you're face-to-face, looking individuals in the eye before you have to kill them.

vegan,700,"Alright, to anyone who is reading this and may be curious about veganism or unsure of what it is, heres a real simple explanation;

Veganism is a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty, whether for food, clothing or any other purpose.

And no, it is not a perfect lifestyle that is 100% void of animal deaths.

Some animals may still die indirectly, but that is the footprint of all humans. Vegans still need to eat and survive, and unfortunately some animals/insects will die due to the human footprint. Sometimes it's unavoidable. If we could change that we would.

While diet is largely a part of veganism, veganism is not just about food, e.g. it encompasses opposing animal vivisection and animal exploitation such as animal circuses and animal imprisonment, and other uses of animals as slaves or objects.

Basically, if an act encompasses exploiting, enslaving, abusing or slaughtering animals then it is opposed and is encompassed within veganism.

If there's a practicable alternative that doesn't involve the above, we will choose that option instead.

If we don't need to exploit and slaughter animals to survive, such as not eating a cow and eating a myriad of plant foods instead - we choose that option.

We show the same respect to cows, lambs, pigs and other wildlife that we would a dog or cat. They all deserve respect. They all want to survive and we don't need to exploit or bring them harm.

This does not mean that we wouldn't defend ourselves against an animal that were to threaten  us harm. Of course, that would be illogical.

""If we could live happy and healthy lives without harming others, why wouldn't we choose that option?"" That's all it is. Respect and kindness to animals who share this planet with us.

Fortunately, from a diet perspective humans will benefit hugely from plant foods, which is awesome because that is in alignment with Veganism. It's a win-win. :)

There's a lot more knowledge to obtain when one decides to live in alignment with veganism, but it really isn't difficult. It takes time to learn, but an open mind is all that's needed.",0

[Ingredients]

For the ""crab"":
~0.67 lbs Laetiporus cincinnatus mushroom, hand shredded
~1.5 nori sheets
~5 strands saffron
~1 tbsp sugar
~1 tbsp salt
~1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning

The rest of the ""crab"" cake ingredients:
~1 cup panko bread crumbs
~0.5 cup vegan mayo
~1 cup red pepper, small dice
~1 cup scallion, chopped
~0.5 cup cilantro, chopped
~1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning
~1 tbsp dried thyme leaves
~1 Tsp salt
~1 Tsp cracked black pepper
~1 Tsp cayenne pepper

For the light batter for the outside of the cakes:
~0.33 cup corn starch
~0.33 cup self rising flour
~add small increments of water until it forms a thin batter

[Directions]

Bring the water, saffron, nori/seaweed/kelp, Old Bay, salt and sugar to a boil, remove from heat, strain and keep all liquid.
Boil the Laetiporus cincinnatus in the reserved liquid for at least 7 minutes. Strain, and chill in the fridge.

Once chilled, add the ""crab"" and all of the other ingredients (except the batter) to a bowl, and mix. Let the ""crab"" cake mixture sit covered in the fridge for at least an hour (for best results, do this the day before cooking them).

Once the mixture has sat in the fridge for at least an hour, form into cakes. I used a 0.25 cup measuring cup to portion out cakes for forming. Once all of the cakes are portioned (should be between 8 and 10 cakes, I made 9), get your vegetable oil to 350 F, dip your cakes in your batter, and fry until golden brown on each side.",0
