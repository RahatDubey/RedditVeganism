2017-09,vegan,3.0,"Here's a copy of a precious response I crafted for a similar topic:

Hey, I'm allergic to peanuts, tree nuts and soy, and also have oral allergy syndrome with most raw fruits and vegetables, especially carrots! Curious- by allergic, do you mean in risk of anaphylactic shock allergic/blood/skin tested allergic or oral allergy allergic? With my oral allergy, if I heat the fruits or veggies, it denatures the protein that makes my throats and inner ears itchy and then all is a-okay!

Instead of soy-based items like tofu and tempeh, I go for seitan (a wheat-gluten based food used as a meat substitute). Easy stuff that I go to when I'm low on grocery budget for the week:

-Stir fry rice with coconut-amino instead of soy (add any veggies you ARE able to have). I glaze mine with a mix of Sriracha, red wine vinegar, a bit of cornstarch and more coconut aminos- yum). Skip the Sriracha if you can't do spice. 

- Pasta and canned tomato sauce (add flavor with garlic, onions, or mushrooms)

- Vegan pizza sans tomato sauce, favorite toppings and vegan cheese if I splurged (speaking of vegan cheese, Daiya is soy-free and not nut-based and holds up well!). Making your own dough is pretty straight forward and inexpensive). You can whip up a vegan ranch dressing or grab vegan BBQ to replace the tomato sauce if you so wish. 

- Fried crispy eggplant (sliced, dipped in any kind of flour, then unflavored coconut or oat milk, then Italian spiced panko)

- Buffalo cauliflower wings with a dip made of vegan Mayo, dill, garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of apple cider vinegar. You can top it with a mix of salt and vinegar, or go light on the hot sauce for a non spicy flair. 

- Plain old rice and beans wrapped in a taco shell with some veggies. 

- Indian coconut curry with golden potatoes and onions. Homemade garlic naan or white rice as a side. You don't have to make it spicy- skip any green peppers. 

- Popcorn topped with a sprinkling of vegan butter, then mixed with: cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and a spritz of lime. Favorite snack of all time. Tastes kind of like fancy Doritos. 

- Speaking of Doritos, most potato chips are vegan.

- Tortola chips as well. Salsa. You can make a vegan queso with potatoes and Daiya cheese- I added a can of beer to mine once and made it into vegan cheddar ale soup- yes. 

- Oreos (do check your country and recent news, their ingredients are... getting fuzzy at best). 

- Baked potatoes with chives and vegan butter, salt and pepper. 

- Sweet potatoes are your friend! I made a roasted version last week and topped them with a spicy mustard aioli sauce that I whipped up from stone ground mustard, yellow mustard and vegan mayo. So versatile, you can also make them sweet and mash with oats and a touch of maple syrup to make a hearty sweet potato cake. 

- Oatmeal with coconut or oat milk. Might want a vanilla flavor version of the milk for this, or just add sugar and a sprinkle of vanilla to it. 

- Coconut ice cream. SO Delicious is a great brand that has some of these and they are vegan and soy free. 

- Mac and Cheese. Daiya has a boxed version that's a good cheat good and is gluten free, but free, soy free and vegan. 

- Vegan pancakes made of banana and oats. Minimalist baker has a good recipe for this one.

Things like buffalo cauliflower, sweet and sour green beans, teriyaki broccoli.  Anything can be livened up.  You'll start to view food differently if you can break the cycle. 

I think of it this way and it's really helped me.  Your body, that is your life, more valuable to you than the most expensive Lamborghini, right?

2017-05,loseit,3.0,"First thing is - I don't know about pizza hut but dominos uk have calorie counts on the website and each slice ends up ~200 slices for a large pizza, and I can say that I think they're pretty on point because I have a load of frozen slices and some days I'll have three slices and it doesn't seem to hinder my loss (I usually have 600-800 left for dinner).

Second thing is - you might be able to bring lower calorie things which are still delicious. I like raw carrots but they wouldn't satisfy me there, but I know buffalo cauliflower and some other recipes which are often shared as ""match food"" (like for superbowl) go down a treat.

Third thing is - the new place I work everyone loves to share food, and I often say no and this has lead to people saying ""I know you'll probably say no but do you want one?"" and the fact that they think I normally say no helps me along a lot of the time, it's like the words they choose give me strength. They think I normally eat good portions for me to still lose weight, so that's cool.

The first few times were really difficult, but after that it gets easier. Today I accepted a choc ice because I knew I could fit it in and that was pretty nice for me. What helps me is thinking ""I can choose to eat this. Will it hinder my progress? If it will, do I want it enough to give up on progress for today?""

Another thing which helps me, especially with things like pizza or wings or buffets which happen quite frequently, is thinking ""I can have each thing, but I only need one to get the taste and enjoy it. The second one won't taste as good."" Sometimes I'm not convinced, but most of the time this means I eat, say, 600cals instead of thousands because I only eat one of each thing. When we had a ""dominos meeting"" (they literally ordered about 12 pizzas and every side I've seen in multiples to make up for the meeting being our lunch break) I kept myself to one slice of each pizza (and one wing and one dipper and one kicker) that I liked the sound of and it kept me from going mad.

2017-10,EatCheapAndHealthy,121.0,"All of my favorite veggies are fall veggies: kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, collard greens, brussel sprouts. I love the entire cruciferous family. Some of my favorite ways to prepare them:

Kale - I like cooking kale in a pan with a bit of olive oil, crushed red pepper flakes and minced garlic then adding a bit of lime juice (lemon juice or vinegar is also good) once it starts to wilt, sprinkling some salt and pepper on top. It's quick and easy and I love eating it on its own or as a side. You can also add beans to it to make it more of a meal (I like using cannelini). For a kinda condiment, I also like just putting kale into a blender with roasted garlic, olive oil, and a bit of red wine vinegar. I put it on sandwiches, toss a bit in pasta, or on anything else I want to add a bit more flavor to.

Broccoli - I just love steaming broccoli and putting some kind of sauce/dressing over it. [This soy balsamic dressing](http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/balsamic-soy-dressing-229008) is one of my favorites. I also like just shredding broccoli up raw and using it as the base of a salad and [this crockpot beef and broccoli](https://therecipecritic.com/2012/11/slow-cooker-beef-and-broccoli/) is one of my favorites, too.

Cauliflower - I love buffalo cauliflower. I just toss the cauliflower in the buffalo sauce and roast it until it starts to get tender and brown. Also love [cauliflower mac and cheese](https://www.kitchenstewardship.com/low-carb-cauli-mac-recipe/).

Cabbage - I love making [these vegan cabbage rolls](http://www.theminimalistvegan.com/vegan-cabbage-rolls/) and I also really love  [this Mexican cabbage soup](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/256474/mexican-cabbage-soup/). And then there's [this sauteed red cabbage](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/2130240592/saut%C3%A9ed-red-cabbage-with-onions-garlic-and) which is seriously TO DIE FOR, the first time I made it I went to town on it and ate a godawful amount. 

Collard greens - I love just throwing some collard greens in the crockpot with plenty of minced garlic, a bit of oil, and some apple cider vinegar and cooking it on high for a few hours. You can also add bacon or ham hock to it if you like but I usually don't. I also love using collard greens in soups like [this one with white beans](https://www.cookforyourlife.org/recipes/collard-greens-white-bean-soup/) and using them in place of cabbage in cabbage roll recipes. 

Brussel sprouts - [Roasted brussel sprouts](http://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/67952/roasted-brussels-sprouts/) are my fave. I like to get them as browned as I can without burning them and they're absolutely fantastic. 

For what I don't like---I hate pumpkin. Every time I've had it (both fresh and canned) it's tasted really iron-y like I had a load of pennies in my mouth and I just really don't like it. I always substitute sweet potato for it in any pumpkin recipe I see that looks good. I'm also not super into celery. Added to soups and things for a bit more flavor, sure, but on it's own I don't really enjoy it.

And for what I want to eat *more* of---pretty much all the fruit. I love apples, I love pears, I love figs and pomegranate and cranberries but I just rarely ever eat any fruit other than using lemons/limes/oranges to flavor other foods with. I don't have a really big sweet tooth so I'd like to look for some more savory recipes using these fruits more than anything, especially cranberries which I don't think I've ever used except to make cranberry sauce with at Thanksgiving.

2017-10,1200isplenty,5.0,"recipe for buffalo cauliflower wings: 
-2 heads of cauliflower (this should make ~25 wings for the sake of the 45 calories per wing count, but it obv varies a bit because some pieces are gonna be way smaller than others and vice versa. use yo judgement.)
-1.5 cups japanese panko breadcrumbs
-1/4 cup white flour
-3 large eggs
-1 cup hot sauce--if you can, get duffs sauce! i've made this recipe 3 times and using this sauce made em come out soooo good
-2 tbsp butter

step 1: cut the cauliflower. you want to make the pieces around the size of boneless chicken wings; you don't really want them any bigger than that.
step 2: take flour and put it in a bowl and coat the cauli with it. 
step 3: set up a dredging station with the eggs in a separate bowl and panko breadcrumbs in another bowl. put the flour coated cauli in the eggs, then coat in breadcrumbs, and place on a cooking sprayed aluminum foil covered pan.
step 4: once all of the coated cauli is on the pan, season generously with salt, pepper, and garlic.
step 5: once the oven has been preheated to 375, put the cauliflower in for 25 mins. you want the cauliflower to be golden brown around the edges.
step 6: add butter to pan over medium heat. add in hot sauce. mix. taste to see if you want it milder, if you do want it milder just add more butter :)
step 7: once cauli is out of oven, increase heat of oven to 400 degrees. then, take hot sauce off of the jet and put the cauli in the pan. mix well so all cauli is evenly coated w the sauce.
step 8: once oven is heated to 400 degrees, put buff cauli back on pan and put in oven for 10 mins
step 9: once cauli is done, allow to sit and cool for 10 mins
step 10: eenjjjoyyy!!!!!

What I eat in a day mainly consists of rice, fruit, veg and beans. I just made some buffalo cauliflower wings from the blog Hot For Food and they were SO GOOD! You can keep your diet simple and just have peanut butter toast and a banana or oats for breakfast. Beans and rice with fajitas for lunch and tofu broccoli stir fry for dinner. B12 is the only vitamin that vegans don't get, it's theorized that we used to get it from the dirt that we ate our plants from but with modern day sanitation it's removed. I'm not sure but it doesn't matter because almost all but milks are fortified with it as well as cereals, and the vegans bff nutritional yeast which is a cheesy tasting powdery flake.

My favorite thing to make is a batch of mini black bean burgers and freeze them so whenever I want one, it’s ready and I can just reheat it. I eat that as mini sliders, on a salad, or with some rice and veggies. You can do the same thing with some falafel which I love and is easy to make or I bought mine from Trader Joe’s and have seen some at Walmart. I love making veggie tacos or burrito bowls (beans, brown rice, onions, peppers, corn, jalapeños, avocado/guac). Another favorite is turning cauliflower into yummy stuff like buffalo cauliflower or Sweet and sour cauliflower. You can eat those with some veggies or rice! I like making kale salads with just some olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onions and for some reason that tastes really really good. (Massage the kale with lemon first and it tastes less bitter).  Also, this may not sound that good but I’m obsessed with eating a can of chickpeas, some diced onions and garlic cooked in a pan with a lot of balsamic vinegar and a little bit of olive oil. After about ten minutes on the stove, the balsamic soaks into the chickpeas and it just tastes so good. 

I don’t eat much fake meat products but if I do I buy Gardein (their mini chicken sliders are my favorite with veggies or a salad on the side). Also soyrizo is pretty amazing to put in tacos or in a breakfast scramble. 

Hope that helps! Like I said, I kinda just eat whatever I want but veganize it and portion it to fit my calorie goal. Eating no meat, dairy or eggs automatically makes the foods I like less calories!

My midterm is next week, and originally the professor said he intended to assign an individual paper for it.  Fast forward to today, where he changed it so now we're doing group presentations instead.  Ugh.  And, we were originally split into 4 groups, but he wanted us in 3 groups, so my group had to absorb 2 members of the group that got broken up.  I'm a little annoyed, but the professor has said that, while our presentation as a whole would be graded as a group, we would also be graded individually on the slides we contribute and the part of the presentation we give.

I had Morningstar veggie dogs for dinner.  I have been afraid to try them because the only other vegetarian hot dogs I've had (Smart Dogs) were absolutely fucking disgusting.  But dude, these were freaking awesome!  They taste just like a hotdog, and the texture isn't weird or anything.  I had some with brown mustard and sauerkraut and it just made my day.

For restaurants not mentioned in that thread (and some that are), I'd like to point out [Tree House](http://treehousestl.com/) (their wild 'shroom ravioli is glorious), [Small Batch](http://smallbatchstl.com/) (their gnocchi, holy shit), [Lona's lil eats](http://lonaslileats.com/) (omg the tofu wrap tho), [Bombay Food Junkies](http://www.bombayfoodjunkies.com/) (samosas for the lord), [SweetArt](http://www.sweetartstl.com/) (their cupcakes will make anyone question any stereotype they've ever held for vegan sweets), [Bailey's Range](http://baileysrange.com/) (my fav veg burger in the lou), [the Vine](http://thevinestl.com/thevinecafe/Home.html) (cheap &amp; awesome falafel), [Retreat Gastropub](http://www.retreatgastropub.com/) (i've only ever had the papperdelle but it's caused me to go back three other times) and even the freakin [Royale](http://www.theroyale.com/) (whose apps/sandwiches I""ve been munchin on for like ten years).

For pizza purposes, I have to go with [Pizzeoli](http://www.pizzeoli.com/) (seriously, try their Soulard or Napoli and tell me they're not as flawless as beyonce).   I could go on, but I think the various Thai / Indian / Mediterranean restaurants are just sort of a given w/regard to veggie options

2017-05,EatCheapAndHealthy,2.0,"As other posters have mentioned, it is definitely helpful to double recipes and freeze some so that you'll have prepared food on hand when you're too tired to cook. Ideally, we'd be able to do this all the time, but I totally understand where you're coming from when you say that sometimes you end up not eating because leftovers are gone and you're too tired to make something new.

Some are healthier than others, but I do usually keep a few freezer meals on hand for those nights. I like Evol brand frozen meals, burritos, and breakfast sandwiches. They rarely go on sale near me, but there are always [coupons on their website](https://www.evolfoods.com/). Another that's been consistently high quality in my experience is [Amy's](https://www.amys.com/our-foods). These ones can also tend to be a bit more expensive than the 'regular brands' but are tasty, heavy on veggies (I think the whole line might be vegetarian?), and go on sale fairly regularly. Cheaper and way healthier than takeout. My favorite is the one that comes with an enchilada, beans, and rice.

When all else fails, I usually buy several bags of the Birds Eye Steamfresh veggies (and veggie/ grain blends) when they go on sale for $1.00-1.50ish. They literally steam in the microwave so they're basically no effort, and they ensure that I'm still eating healthy-ish when I don't have time to cook. I love the [protein blends](https://www.birdseye.com/vegetable-products/birdseye-steamfresh/birds-eye-steamfresh-protein-blends) because they can make a decent meal on their own. The [Flavor Full](https://www.birdseye.com/vegetable-products/birdseye-steamfresh/birds-eye-steamfresh-flavor-full) ones are good, too. I like to make the buffalo cauliflower as a snack sometimes... even if you eat the entire bag it's only 150 calories (although it *is* 54% of your sodium for the day, so something to watch out for).",1,1

I'm back! Honeymoon was amazing. Denver is the best. A million breakfast places!! Now I have 60+ emails to sort through this morning at work woooooo

Ate keto but didn't track during the trip - pretty pumped. I chose to stay on track except for two instances. The first was a carne asada burrito from my favorite burrito place from my hometown which oddly also has locations in Denver. Seriously, it's just in two cities in the entire country and one is my hometown in Arizona and one is Denver?? The burrito was actually completely keto friendly except the tortilla - just steak, guacamole, sour cream, and pico. The second was buffalo cauliflower bites at Alamo Draft House. I ordered them thinking they'd just be baked in buffalo sauce like I make them at home, but they were breaded. Still not sad I ate them.

2017-02,vegan,3.0,"A few options:

1) Gardein brand cutlets. They're basically imitation chicken and pre-breaded.

2) Tofu. To get rid of the tofu flavour, boil some salted water and pour it over the tofu (put the tofu in a strainer). Let sit for ten minutes. You can then use [this buffalo cauliflower recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/02/crispy-buffalo-fried-cauliflower-recipe.html) on the tofu. Why tofu? The texture of tofu will be closer to a texture like that of white meat than cauliflower will. You can try caulfilower too though if you want, but I've found that it comes out fairly watery and that diminishes the flavour.


I'd also add about 1-2 tsp No-chicken bouillon (either a brand such as Better Than Bouillon brand) or [make your own](http://theminiaturemoose.com/no-chicken-bouillon-vegan-gluten-free-only-4-ingredients/). Omit salt in this case, as either brand or homemade No-chicken bouillon will be very salty. Also the vinegar of a cayenne-based hot sauce will add enough tang to offset the need for extra salt.",1,1
2017-08,vegan,14.0,"Hey, I'm allergic to peanuts, tree nuts and soy, and also have oral allergy syndrome with most raw fruits and vegetables, especially carrots! Curious- by allergic, do you mean in risk of anaphylactic shock allergic/blood/skin tested allergic or oral allergy allergic? With my oral allergy, if I heat the fruits or veggies, it denatures the protein that makes my throats and inner ears itchy and then all is a-okay!

Instead of soy-based items like tofu and tempeh, I go for seitan (a wheat-gluten based food used as a meat substitute). Easy stuff that I go to when I'm low on grocery budget for the week:

-Stir fry rice with coconut-amino instead of soy (add any veggies you ARE able to have). I glaze mine with a mix of Sriracha, red wine vinegar, a bit of cornstarch and more coconut aminos- yum). 

- Pasta and canned tomato sauce (spice it up with garlic, onions, and plenty of red pepper flakes)

- Vegan pizza with sauce, favorite toppings and vegan cheese if I splurged (speaking of vegan cheese, Daiya is soy-free and not nut-based and holds up well!). Making your own dough is pretty straight forward and inexpensive). 

- Fried crispy eggplant (sliced, dipped in any kind of flour, then unflavored coconut or oat milk, then Italian spiced panko)

- Buffalo cauliflower wings with a dip made of vegan Mayo, dill, garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of apple cider vinegar. 

- Plain old rice and beans wrapped in a taco shell with hot sauce. 

- Indian coconut curry with golden potatoes and onions. Homemade garlic naan or white rice as a side. 

- Popcorn topped with a sprinkling of vegan butter, then mixed with: cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and a spritz of lime. Favorite snack of all time. Tastes kind of like fancy Doritos. 

- Speaking of Doritos, most potato chips are vegan.

- Tortola chips as well. Salsa. You can make a vegan queso with potatoes and Daiya cheese- I added a can of beer to mine once and made it into vegan cheddar ale soup- yes. 

- Oreos (do check your country and recent news, their ingredients are... getting fuzzy at best). 

- Baked potatoes with chives and vegan butter, salt and pepper. 

- Sweet potatoes are your friend! I made a roasted version last week and topped them with a spicy mustard aioli sauce that I whipped up from stone ground mustard, yellow mustard and vegan mayo. So versatile, you can also make them sweet and mash with oats and a touch of maple syrup to make a hearty sweet potato cake. 

- Oatmeal with coconut or oat milk. Might want a vanilla flavor version of the milk for this, or just add sugar and a sprinkle of vanilla to it. 

- Coconut ice cream. SO Delicious is a great brand that has some of these and they are vegan and soy free. 

- Mac and Cheese. Daiya has a boxed version that's a good cheat good and is gluten free, but free, soy free and vegan. 

- Vegan pancakes made of banana and oats. Minimalist baker has a good recipe for this one.

&amp;nbsp;

**Baked Buffalo Cauliflower Tots**

Total: 9 hr 25 min

Active: 1 hr

Yield: 6 servings (about 36 tots, 1 cup sauce)

Level: Intermediate

&amp;nbsp;

**Ingredients**

1/2 cup low-fat plain yogurt

1/4 cup mayonnaise

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

1 tablespoon 2-percent milk

1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Pinch cayenne pepper

1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Cauliflower Tots**

1 tablespoon olive oil

1/2 small onion, finely chopped

2 small heads cauliflower

1 cup almond meal or almond flour

2 large eggs, separated

1/4 cup hot sauce, plus more for serving

Kosher salt

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

2 cups crispy rice cereal

Cooking spray

Special equipment: Cheesecloth

&amp;nbsp;

**Directions**

1. For the blue cheese sauce: Whisk together the yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice, milk, Worcestershire and cayenne in a medium bowl until smooth. Gently stir in the blue cheese. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days, covered, to let the flavors develop.

2. For the cauliflower tots: Position an oven rack at the top of the oven, and preheat to 450 degrees F. Set a cooling rack on a rimmed baking sheet.

3. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until browned and soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and let cool in the skillet.

4. Remove and discard the outer leaves and core of the cauliflower. Separate the heads into large florets, and trim away most of the stems. Process half the florets in a food processor until very finely chopped, almost a paste. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining florets.

5. Lay out a large double layer of cheesecloth, and put the cauliflower paste in the middle. Gather up the sides into a bundle. Hold the bundle over the sink, and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you possibly can (there will be a fair amount). Put the remaining cauliflower back into the bowl (it should be fairly dry now).

6. Add the browned onion, almond meal, egg whites, hot sauce, 2 teaspoons salt and cayenne to the cauliflower, and work together with your hands until combined and the mixture holds together when squeezed.

7. Scoop out even tablespoonfuls of the cauliflower mixture. Roll each into a ball, shape into a squared-off tot shape and place on a baking sheet. (The tots can be covered loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to overnight.)

8. Pulse the rice cereal in the food processor until finely ground, then transfer it to a small dish. Whisk the egg yolks with 1/4 cup water in a medium bowl. Line up the tots, egg wash, ground cereal and prepared baking sheet (with rack) on your work surface. Dip each tot in the egg wash, letting the excess liquid drip off, then roll in the cereal to fully coat and place on the baking sheet. (To avoid a mess, designate one hand for the dipping and retrieving in the egg and the other for rolling in the cereal.) Spray each tot all over with the cooking spray, turning as needed. (The unsprayed breaded tots can be frozen on a parchment-lined baking sheet until solid, about 2 hours, then transferred to a large freezer bag and frozen for up to 1 month.)

9. Bake the tots on the prepared baking sheet until golden brown outside and hot inside, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a serving platter. Shake some hot sauce on top. Serve with the blue cheese sauce. (If baking the tots from frozen, coat with cooking spray and bake for until golden brown outside and hot inside, 15 to 20 minutes.)

2017-01,proED,8.0,"Cauliflower! There's a thread about it already, honestly it's amazing because it's low calorie for big portions and it's versatile. Cauliflower rice is a good one, tomato based pasta sauce is also pretty low cal and will mask the cauliflower taste. 

I've read good things about zoodles too although never tried them. 

Shirataki (konjac) noodles are nearly 0 calories and can be used in loads of dishes, they do Konjac rice and pasta too. I love konjac pasta with tomato-y pasta sauces and some chicken breast, it's filling and low calorie. 

Scrambled egg whites + chicken breast pieces is good too, it's quite high in protein which I think makes me feel fuller for longer. 

Broccoli and spinach are delicious too, with a bit of seasoning or garlic. They're really low cal and you can roast the broccoli if you like a crunchy texture. I'm gonna try roasting green beans because I saw a recipe on Reddit and it looked nice. I did roasted buffalo cauliflower today and it was nice. 

Lean meat is filling cos of the protein content and there's loads of vegetables which are low cal so you can eat a big portion of those to help fill you up. I always season and flavour vegetables and try to cook them so they're the most delicious so it's mentally satiating too and I enjoy it :) 

Also keeping hydrated, lots of hot drinks and water/sugar free squash helps. Some people find diet sodas filling too, others say it makes them crave sweet food more. In America they have flavoured tea like 'birthday cake' flavour which sounds amaaazing! But I've never found a uk version ",1,1
2017-06,vegan,1.0,"I disagree with your belief that omni restaurants with vegan options don't convert people to veganism.

As a recently-minted vegan (16 months), one of the biggest things that delayed my ultimate conversion was a fear of monotony. 

I have pretty bad ADD, and this also manifests itself in the form of getting bored easily with food. Moving to Los Angeles opened up a whole world of vegan food options to me (courtesy of vegan and omni restaurants alike) that up to that point seemed impossible. But that ever-present access made conversion so much easier.

Whether it's a black bean burger at Swingers in Santa Monica, a pie with Daiya from Blaze, ZPizza, etc., Buffalo Cauliflower at Mohawk Bend, or roasted Brussels sprout tacos at Diablo, these are all examples of vegan-friendly omni restaurants that make transitioning to veganism soooo much easier than it would otherwise be, and it should be encouraged.

2017-12,vegetarian,2.0,"These [buffalo cauliflower wings](https://www.peta.org/living/food/spicy-buffalo-cauliflower-wings/) are really good. Like, *really* good. The texture is also oddly similar to chicken, though just different enough, that you could easily mistake it for the ""real"" deal. Might help if you're having meat cravings, or just want something spicy.

This [vegan lunch meat recipe](http://www.plantbasedkindness.com/recipe/vegan-gluten-free-deli-meat-bologna-style/) is also really good. Flavor is almost exactly like tofu dogs, so you could probably also make your own if you roll it into tubes with parchment paper and bake that way. I've been meaning to try that, and probably will come spring/summer.

Since you're allergic to dairy, nutritional yeast will go a loooooong way if you're looking for a cheesy flavor. It's most similar to cheez its or other baked cheeses, but it's really good. Honestly prefer it a bit to real cheese as I can add more to get a stronger flavor without adding hundreds of calories to my day. You can also use it to make [vegan queso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVCOYQXGzYo) which, without the salsa, can be used as a base for dairy-free scalloped potatoes or mac'n'cheese.

[King oyster mushrooms are often used as a replacement for pulled pork](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/4dqoqb/king_oyster_mushroom_pulled_pork_barbecue/). I haven't personally tried it, but [jackfruit is also a common replacement](https://www.emilieeats.com/easy-vegan-bbq-jackfruit-sandwiches/) if you can get your hands on it.

Also, for the hell of it, here's some [faux-egg](http://freefromharm.org/food-products/delicious-vegan-eggs-recipes/) recipes. Most of them are packed chalk full of protein, but without all the cholesterol. A lot of the signature egg flavor comes from sulfur, in which case kala namak comes in handy. It's a sulfuric Indian salt, also known as black salt.

Other than that, [BudgetBytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/vegetarian/vegan/) has a lot of good vegan recipes that are also cheap. Some of which are as cheap as a couple of quarters a serving. Even if you're not on a budget, one of the best benefits of a vegan (or even mostly-plant based) diet is the fact it's a lot cheaper.



For some quick fixes, I like to cut potatoes into little rings about 1/4"" thick and bake (no oil, just straight on the tray) at about 400 for 15-20 minutes. Once they freely slide around with a shake of the tray, they're good. Then I dip them in whatever I have available: mustard, hummus, salsa, etc. You can do this with pretty much any root vegetable as far as I'm aware, just the cook times vary. 

Not sure if you have an Aldi near you, but their dirty rice, jambalaya, couscous, etc boxes are some good stuff for $1. Very filling, very delicious, and if I'm not mistaken, vegan until you add butter (which I omit entirely, don't even replace it) or meat. Quick as heck to make, too. A little higher in sodium than I'd like, though. There's also a lot of good vegetarian soups. Not sure about you, but I'm a huge fan of tomato basil. Aldi also has a really good harvest vegetable soup that is vegetarian, though I'm not sure if it has milk or not. I believe it doesn't.

I hope some of this helps!

For the tacos, I liked mixing equal parts meatless ""ground beef"" (you can get this at almost any supermarket; I know Walmart has it) and Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo. The ""ground beef"" was really bland on its own, but it got decent seasoning from the chorizo. I'd also pick up a can of vegetarian refried beans and a packet of hot taco seasoning. They always came out really good.

I can't find the recipe I used for the mushroom stroganoff, but there are tons out there. I didn't make mine too creamy, and I eventually started cooking the mushrooms in a combination of red wine and Worcestershire sauce. It always came out really good. One of my all-time favorite recipes to make. Even my non-veg friends loved it.

For the cauliflower wings, there are a TON of recipes over on /r/vegrecipes if you sort through the top posts. I never got mine crispy enough, and I made a beer batter to coat them in, but they were a nice substitute for the days I was really craving hot wings.",1,1

I don't find sriracha hot at all, but I also am a heat addict. I would not recommend using it as a marinade, especially if this is your first rodeo with hot sauces. I only ever really use hot sauces to top foods (except buffalo cauliflower wings).

What about bbq sauce? I always buy mine and it makes [really great tofu](http://imgur.com/a/JKPnb). I don't know how well it works with veggies, except sweet potatoes (I use it instead of ketchup for sweet potato fries).

Have you tried pesto before? A lot of the pre-made ones are not vegan but its really easy to make. You just need 2 cups of herbs, 2 T of nuts, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 c oil, and optional 1/4 c nooch. I usually do parsley with walnuts and canola oil, but traditionally it's basil, pine nuts, and olive oil. Here you just blend everything together.

2017-05,EatCheapAndHealthy,3.0,"Those are great options. If you're looking for a little more diversity, perhaps you could try some of the veggie blends. These come frozen with two or more types of veggies in the same bag. For example, you can typically find a blend of carrots, peas, and corn. This would be great to throw in a quick soup, maybe even fried rice or something. You can also get veggie blends for specific purposes, i.e. I recently bought a bag of frozen mixed stir-fry veggies which made it possible to throw together a stir fry in just a few minutes with very little effort.

Another option would be to get the Steamers (or another brand with the same concept). You literally just throw them in the microwave, in the bag, and you're done. My favorite is the [Buffalo Cauliflower](https://www.birdseye.com/vegetable-products/flavorfull/buffalo-cauliflower), but there are other options too.

2017-08,CrohnsDisease,1.0,"So... I could have written this post. Without the fainting.

Vegetarian and moderate pancolitis. Went veg because meat stopped tasting good and, when I do have a craving (for hot wings for example) it's typically because I want the flavor of the sauce, not the meat. Buffalo cauliflower bites for the win. 

One of the problems I/we run into, especially if you're not eating a ton of processed food, is getting enough salt. Seriously. People ask me, ""But how do you get your protein?"" and are shocked when I tell them that's not my main problem, but getting enough salt is.

Add to that I'm a long distance runner and salt suddenly becomes really important to me.

So... typically what I've found is that the salt needs to be easily ingest-able. A high-sodium drink is great. Red Bulls actually pack that dual punch of caffeine/sodium that perks me up at 2:00 in the afternoon. Or just add salt to something.

I had also done Nuun tabs once or twice a day (until they changed their formula) and use Vitalyte as a sports drink as well as an extreme pick me up.

In addition, I make sure to salt my food, within reason. One thing here... eating something made with salt, like bread, is NOT the same as eating something you've put salt on. Hell - in certain circumstances I've actually just dumped a tsp of salt into my hand and sucked it up. Salted nuts are good too if you can handle them.

You also need to watch your potassium. Mine typically runs high in lab work (though kidney function is fine) but sometimes I need it. Careful here because sodium and potassium don't' play well together.

I still drink 80 ounces of water a day, and just use my urine color as a barometer. Too yellow, not enough, and possibly need salt. Extremely clear and I'm peeing every 30 minutes, probably need to cut back.

Also - if you're using something other than table salt, make sure you check your iodine levels. There are vegan supplements you can take that will help.

On the same hand, my family is notorious for heart disease, heart attacks, etc. so I try to make sure I'm not overdoing it on my salt.",1,1

Edit: ok, I've thought of a few more things that I wanted to share :)  we have some staples that we keep on hand. We always have applesauce because you can bake anything oil free if you replace the oil with apple sauce- it's awesome in cornbread! We often make chili and put it in a baking dish and whip up some cornbread and pour it on top of the chili and bake it until the cornbread is cooked for tamale pie.  

We also keep tahini, a ton of condiments, liquid aminos, loads of spices and frozen fruits and veggies. Chickpeas are awesome because you can do so much with them like make a mock tuna or chicken salad, hummus (with the tahini, no oil needed!), crunchy chickpea snack. And popcorn kernels. You can pour some kernels into a paper bag and pop in the microwave without oil. Then I'll spritz the popcorn with some liquid aminos and a light dusting of nooch. My kids LOVE that as a snack.

**Rotisserie Chicken with Butter Lettuce** really simple. pull apart a rotisserie chicken and wrap it in lettuce for roll ups. I'll usually add some cheese, maybe sour cream. 

**Cauliflower Fauxtato Salad** cook cauliflower, use half sour cream/half mayo, add in bacon, cheese if you want, spices, it's pretty good. Sometimes I'll add jalapeno/artichoke dip for a little heat which is really good. 

**Pork Rinds &amp; Guacamole** 

**Buffalo Cauliflower** just steam cauliflower, add butter and buffalo sauce

2017-04,1200isplenty,4.0,"So I keep a few go-tos here. Frozen steamer veggies in sauce... an entire package is usually under 150cal and I keep my favorites on hand always. Having the sauce already there makes it more exciting than plain vegetables and also helps fill a savory craving that plain veggies wouldn't. *(Adding a wedge of laughing cow cheese to buffalo cauliflower makes it so creamy and indulgent if you're into buffalo sauce.)* 

I like canned green beans in a pinch but they aren't something I love. Once upon a time ages ago I had a freaking case of them from Costco sitting in my pantry and somehow my rule of thumb became that if I was going to go over my daily calories it'd be on green beans. This forced me to ask myself  *hey, are you actually hungry enough to eat a can of green beans?* If so, I'd eat the green beans, if not I'd close the fridge/pantry and walk away realizing that I'm not hungry I'm just bored.

p.s. - IF is definitely not for everyone. I have honestly never been a breakfast eater so when the whole *breakfast is the most important meal of the day* thing was all the rage I'd try to choke it down and end up feeling as pukey as you feel not eating. ",1,1

**They were called Buffalo Cauliflower**

* Start by blanching &amp; shocking cauliflower florets. 
* When they've cooled, soak them in Hot Sauce, I loved Franks Red Hot.  Its cheap and tasty!
* Then set up a battering station with flour, buttermilk, and more flour.
* Take a floret, toss in flour, then toss into buttermilk, and toss again in flour or any bread coating.
* We would freeze them at this point, and fry them to order.

**Super good tasting, served with ranch.**

*Or... My personal favorite, ""Chipotle Ranch Sauce"".*

 Which can be made by:

* Remove chipotle from can, wipe off, then mince very finely
* Take the caning sauce from the chipotle can.  Add to ranch.  To taste.  Salt &amp; Pepper if needed ;D",1,1

2017-12,vegan,2.0,"I think peta offers a free vegan starter kit. You might check that out. Also as far as food goes, you don't need to have fake meats and stuff if they aren't available where you are at. You can start by veganizing recipes that you already eat. 

Spaghetti? Just make it without meat. Burgers? Make your own black bean burgers. Stir fry? Just leave out the meat. Super broke? Rice and beans. Tacos? How about buffalo cauliflower tacos. Cheese?
 Try making your own cashew cheese. There's so many recipes out there that can be made with staples you can get in any grocery store. 

If you do make a trip to whole foods I'd get a couple of cooking staples that may be easier to find there like a giant tub of earth balance butter/a giant tub of just mayo/and a giant container of nutritional yeast. 

You can also order food online from vegan essentials. 
Also there's sooo many good cookbooks out there. Vegan cupcakes take over the world, the vegan stoner cookbook, veganomicon, the taco cleanse, and there's vegan cooking youtube channels such as hot for food and vegan macgyver.

They're a vegan fried 'chicken' shop. I was sceptical, but oh my god the food is outstanding. My meat-eating friend said he thought it was better than real chicken. Make of that what you will!

Also, hot for food's buffalo cauliflower wings recipe on Youtube is vegan and delicious. If fact, hot for food are great in general, as are Edgy Veg who veganise popular junk foods among other things. If you're more health conscious I recommend Lily Koi Hawaii and That Vegan Couple.

I gave up meat/animal products a year ago for ethical reasons and can honestly say it was the best decision I've ever made. I wish I'd done it sooner. Feel free to PM any time if you have any questions or want advice about changing your diet or about veganism/vegetarianism in general. /r/vegan is a great place to find out more about animal rights and diet and is full of people who'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

Look for flax based wraps, they should be your best bet for no eggs that won't fall apart and works with sweet stuff.

Good luck with everything! Enjoy the cashew cream, definitely turn it into ranch soon (I'm currently addicted to buffalo cauliflower with cashew ranch).",1,1
2017-09,vegan,2.0,"Okay, based on this I would try making a lot of sandwiches because they're super quick and easy and you said that you can stomach tomatoes and the sort in that setting! I would try to sub in spinach instead of lettuce in your sandwiches (for example make a BLT but use spinach instead of lettuce), this is just because lettuce has little to no nutritional value but spinach is packed full of nutrients! Spinach is also one of the veggies you can hide easily. I'd suggest packing a couple cups of spinach in the blender with fruit for a smoothie :)

Try throwing some broccoli into a pasta dish (mac &amp; cheese is my favorite), because in ny experience broccoli works really well in pasta dishes. The same goes for peas! 

How do you feel about potatoes? I know a lot of vegan cheese sauces use a blend of carrots and potatoes so maybe that's the way to go for you. I'll find some recipes and link them here with an edit soon.

Again, because you really don't seem to like veggies, I think the key for you would be to hide them with other flavors. I went to a plant-based restaurant recently and I swear they transformed the flavor of some vegetables into something COMPLETELY different, it was wild. 

Also since you like carrots and I noticed you said you like desserts earlier you can try combining the two and make vegan carrot cake! I had some carrot-cake cupcakes for my birthday and they were delicious. A healthy alternative to what you might normally eat!

I'll link to a few recipes here I think you ought to give a try, but I recommend looking at the hot for food blog I linked and searching ""sandwich"" or ""pasta"" or whatever your in the mood for. They have a ton of really great recipes that use veggies but transform the flavor.

[BLT Sandwich](https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/recipes/2014/3/25/bkt-sandwich?rq=Sandwich) - I would sub in spinach for the kale or if you can't handle spinach use lettuce. I don't imagine you're a fan a kale haha

[Broccoli &amp; Cheese Stuffed Pasta Shells](https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/recipes/2015/9/23/broccoli-cheese-stuffed-shells?rq=Pasta) - this could be a good way to incorporate broccoli into a dish for you

[Buffalo Cauliflower Sandwich](https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/recipes/2014/11/1/vegan-buffalo-cauliflower-sandwich?rq=Sandwiches) - something worth trying, although it does make cauliflower the star of the dish. Again I'd try subbing the spinach in for lettuce when you can.

[Vegan Carrot Cake](https://minimalistbaker.com/1-bowl-vegan-gluten-free-carrot-cake/) - a little bit of work, but it's also gluten-free and Minimalist Baker's recipes are to die for (here's her [website](https://minimalistbaker.com/) to)!

[Vegan Nachos](https://mywholefoodlife.com/2014/03/03/super-easy-vegan-nachos/) - easy way to incorporate beans and tomatoes, and you can try experimenting with a homemade cheese-sauce too!

-fac'n, lettuce, tomato, pesto mayo
-fake sloppy joes made with lentils, TVP, or just out of the box to start (basically salty TVP)
-field roast spicy sausace with fried green peppers, onions, mushrooms on a good toasted bread 

Stew:
-Curry. Get good paste, coconut milk, and throw in whatever veggies (fried tofu for protein or nuts)
-Lentils (red can go in slow cooker)
-fried rice
-burritos
-pastas (just veggie) - try making one with spaghetti squash cos that's always fun
-boil ramen, rise it with cold water when almost done, and fry noodles + veggies + sauces
-bowls, my dude. Throw a carb down and put whatever you want on top (I love sushi bowl).

Then I just pour buffalo sauce over them (I usually spot an accidentally vegan one at the grocery store, if not just mix veg butter(or mayo) and hot sauce together)

Mac n chz:
Pasta duh, most boxed pasta is veg, cook it how you like but i try to make it al dente (not mushy/soft yet) so when I add the rest of the ingredients later the pasta doesn’t over cook. 
So after I’ve drained my pasta, I put it back in the same pot I used to boil it so it’s already nice and warm, put the heat to med-low, add lots of nutritional yeast (I probably used 1/3-1/2 cup per box of pasta), lots of pepper, salt, garlic and onion powder to taste, a generous splash of veg milk, and veg cheese (I used follow your heart cheddar shreds SO GOOD) use as much as you like, i probably use 1/2 cup? Not sure, I eyeball everything. Mix it all until the cheese has melted. It might look a little liquidy at first but let it sit for a few minutes and it’ll thicken up a bit. 

Green tomatoes: I love fried green tomatoes, but breading them is such a messy annoying process and I found they taste just as good just sliced up and cooked until soft in a skillet with a little oil or veg butter and salt and pepper. I cook green tomatoes like this and put them on sandwiches a lot and it’s delicious ",1,1

for today, the berries and clementines are my food that i eat from 7:30am-12:30pm while at my first job. the smoothie in itself takes me a few hours to finish, so i eat that in the afternoon at my second job (1pm-5pm). i eat the salad during my night class, from 5pm-8pm. then when i get home, i work out, burn around 300 calories, and will have some other kind of small meal. 

i'm now realizing that this may work out for me because i'm able to eat while at my jobs (and during class), so i'm consistently eating every hour on the hour. on the days where i can't eat something every hour, i notice that i save the majority of my calories for dinner. interesting realization!",1,1

2017-01,EatCheapAndHealthy,5.0,"I like to make burrito bowls with shredded carrots and diced peppers (bell, poblano, etc). I sauté them in a bit of olive oil and season with cayenne, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic, etc. I really like these with black beans, quinoa or rice and a dollop of Greek yogurt. Also good in wraps. Add meat if wanted.

I've started to just carry lettuce or spinach with me almost all of the time. I snack on it. I add it to whatever food I'm making. So this week I had buffalo cauliflower (also a really good dish or side on its own) wraps with a crumbled black bean burger, romaine and cheddar. But I've also thrown in spinach with leftover soup, stir fry, etc. Stir fry is also great for all sorts of vegetables.

Making mashed potatoes? Throw in some carrots and parsnips. Add in garlic and seasoning. I like chives but those are optional. Now you have mashed root vegetables. How about homemade hash browns? Add some shredded zucchini.

I also like to stuff veggies with whatever (grains, veggies, etc.). A current favorite has been acorn squash. Cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, spread butter or olive oil on it, season with salt, pepper and a dash of brown sugar. Cooks in about 40 min. Add some herbs toward the end so they don't burn. Serve with any dish you desire.

Lentil salad with random veggies is also good. You can do the same with quinoa too. So if it's toward the end of the week and your veggies are going bad, just chop up the odds and ends and put them in either. Season as desired. Dijon and/or honey add some fun to these dishes.

As many people have said, roasted veggies are great. As someone who is mostly veg now, I would honestly say the thing that has made me better at cooking veggies and finding uses for them is by making myself only cook veggies for a meal a few times a month. Obviously, this has gone up over time in my situation but trying a ""meatless Monday"" here and there will let you experiment. But by biggest tip is to just have fun with it!",1,1

2017-07,skeptic,7.0,"I completely agree with her. When I watched this movie I was incredibly skeptical about the whole thing as soon as he got into the conspiracies about food organizations and said that vaganism cures cancer. I was agreeing with the film (to point) until he went overboard. 

I'm all for scientific documentaries about our diets,  but I don't believe a vegan diet is going to change your life or cure cancer. I do believe it's one of the healthiest diets you can be on, but you can eat pretty healthy on a strict diet that includes meat. 

I've been a vegetarian for a while now and when he said that ""it only takes two weeks for all your ailments to be healed"" it reminded me of a snake oil salesman. There are no such things as cure alls. If someone claims it will heal all your illnesses, they're full of shit. 

But, being the true skeptic I am, I tired being vegan for two weeks. Here's what I learned: 

1. It's annoying as fuck. You have to literally look at every ingredient in every food, ever. I imagine if you've been doing this for years it's easier and you know which foods you can eat. But, holy shit was it difficult to find vegan food that wasn't just stir fried veggies or beans. 
I live in oklahoma so access to vegan foods are limited. In the film he goes to a grocery store and buys only vegan food and says ""wow, you bought all this food for 20 bucks"" I laughed at the screen. The food they had bought was all vegetables (and it wasn't even that many vegetables) and really nothing else. If your going vegan, the first thing you have to do it figure out and rebuy all your staples. I've a vegetarian so I didn't have to replace that much stuff, mostly milk, eggs, cheese, honey, ect. But if your a meat-eater and you're going vegan, be prepared to spend a ton of money at the grocery store. Every single thing you buy has to be meat/dairy free. And while that may be cheaper in bigger cites that accommodate for that, in rural Oklahoma those specialty items are hard to find and expensive. Any food items that were dairy/gluten/gmo free were marked up at least 15%. A regular cheese pizza at target is ~5 bucks. I went to Whole Foods and a cheese pizza that was diary/gluten/gmo free was 12 fucking dollars. It was fucking crazy to me. Literally all I ate was stir fried vegetables and beans for two weeks. 

2. When I went to go out with my friends I felt like I was inconveniencing them. Anytime you go out to eat you have to find a restaurant that serves those kinds of foods, which in bumfuck oklahoma, is nowhere. So when I go to restaurant I get a shitty house salad and French fries (if they weren't friend in oil that contains animal fat or friend with meat) it was kind of embarrassing. Everyone else is eating big meals and you're just sitting there picking through pretty much just lettuce on a plate. Granted, not every restaurant is like this and many chain restaurants are putting vegetarian options on the menu. Chili's has awesome buffalo cauliflower that tastes amazing. But I can't even have that because it's beer battered and covered in blue cheese. It was so annoying. If I didn't make it myself, I couldn't eat it.

3. It annoyed my girlfriend. She isn't vegan, hell she isn't even vegetarian. So when I announced ""I shall become vegan for two weeks"" she said ""what the fuck am I supposed to eat?"" She didn't want to join in my experiment, so of course we had to eat two completely different meals every night and we couldn't order pizza on pizza night. (Pizza Hut white sauce, thin crust with olives, mushroom, spinach, peppers, and tomatoes. Fucking delicious. We get it every Friday.) when we made dinner I had a pan with my stuff and she had a pan with her stuff and we got in the way of each other and it was a whole annoying mess. And she ate our pizza in front of me ��. 

I'm not trying to say veganism is bad. (I think quite the opposite.) I'm just saying it's not for everyone. I imagine my experience would be different if I lived in a different area that offered more options, if I could actually afford the options I did have, and if my girlfriend was also vegan. But, even with all of my challenges eating this diet, it wasn't worth it. I didn't really feel different, I felt a little healthy because I wasn't eating junk food like pizza or Doritos, but that comes with any diet. Everyone's body is different and reacts different to different diets. I became a vegetarian because of the environment, and because of animal welfare. I didn't do it because some dude in a documentary told me that eating meat will give me horrible illness or *not* eating meat will cure cancer. I did it for my own reasons, and people who are vegan did it for theirs. If you want to be vegan, more power to you and I hope you stick with it, it's healthy and good for the environment. But if you don't want to be, well that's cool too; but, you have to understand and learn about how our meat industry works and how we may able to change that. We do have a huge problem with our meat industry and if we are going to continue eating meat we have to find a solution.

I didn't mean for this to be the length of Grapes of Wrath, but I've been stewing about this film for a month now. 

TL;DR: the documentary has some good info, but it's mostly bullshit. I tried veganism for two weeks and i didn't really feel that different. ",1,1

2017-10,loseit,1.0,"Hey, I've been there and it's hard. A few strategies to help:

**For Restaurants**

Look up the nutrition facts for your go-to places and put together a few safe meals that fit your calorie goals. You're not hungry or rushing to order, so you can take time to think about what's going to be a fairly balanced meal with good nutrition. You can keep your list on the notepad of your phone or wherever. It's much easier for me to pick a healthy option over a deep fried cheese bomb when I'm not feeling those hunger pangs. 

When you go to the restaurant, don't even look at the menu. Just look at the mini menu you've built for yourself and order that. 

**For the Grocery Store**

Restaurants aren't your only option for food you don't have to cook! First, there are tons of frozen or refrigerated meal options. In the frozen section, check out Lean Cuisines (especially the black boxes), Healthy Choice (especially the Cafe Steamers line) and Amy's (all vegetarian, possibly in a different section of the aisle). If you have a Trader Joe's, they have some delish frozen meals with reasonable calorie counts, too. 

You can also build a meal from grocery store components. Pick up a rotisserie chicken from the deli, frozen pre-cooked rice or microwave minute rice, a can of black beans, a can of corn and a jar of salsa. Boom, ""homemade"" burrito bowls. Bulk up the nutrition of a carby frozen meal by getting a bag of those washed and prepped steam in bag veggies from the produce section, or a veggie side like buffalo cauliflower from the frozen section. 

**For Cooking**

My favorite blog for beginner cooks is www.BudgetBytes.com. She has step by step instructions that are very simple, with pictures of the whole process throughout for you to follow. I'm pretty skilled in the kitchen but her recipes are some of my go-to's for when I've had a long exhausting day and don't want to spend an hour in the kitchen. I've made quite a few things and they've all been delicious. 

Also, check out crockpot recipes. You could make some really simple soups, pulled pork, salsa chicken, etc. and then bulk out the rest of your meal with stuff that's easy to buy at the grocery store. ",1,1

Keep Progresso vegetable soups on hand for when I don't feel like cooking or I need to eat NOW to stave off a binge from too much restricting. 

I make my own black bean burgers and freeze them, then cook from frozen (in toaster oven) so they don't fall apart.

What else?? LENTILS!!! Oh my god, all the lentils.. Green lentils, red lentils (especially red lentils!)... Curried! In soup! However the fuck you like to season food, lentils are fucking amazing! 

Roasted veggies are lifeeeeeeee!!!! Brussels sprouts &amp; cauliflower are my favorite ever, but roasting really brings out flavors that no other cooking method does. I also indulge in buffalo cauliflower ""wings"" from time to time. 

Spaghetti. Fucking. Squash. Aldi &amp; Costco have 'em for cheap. Cut it in half, and with a little spritz of olive oil in a spray can (also available at Aldi) and a generous sprinkling of seasonings, throw it in the toaster oven on 400F and voila! delicious vegetable spaghetti you will be eating for the next 3 days! I probably should have listed this in the 1st paragraph with the other stuff I eat spaghetti sauce on, but whatever. You can eat this with really any sauce or anything you want. It's a fantastic low-cal substitute for noodles, rice, or any carb really. Smother it in whatever. 

A lot of times I just cook whatever the ""normal"" meat-infused food would be, omitting the meat. One thing that works astonishingly well is chili. Beans, tomatoes, onion, tomato paste, maybe a splash of wine, and a metric fuckton of seasoning, and it just tastes like good chili, no meat necessary. Instead of cheese I dump a truckload of shredded lettuce, more fresh diced tomatoes, maybe some black olives, scallions, etc., on top (anything you'd put on nachos goes great on a bowl of chili). I fed this to my brother and it didn't even register there was no meat in it. He loved it. 

JACKFRUIT, holy shit I can't believe I almost forgot about this. Young Green Jackfruit in canned goods at any Asian market (NOT in syrup or brine!), drain, pull the strands of fruit off the hard sections they're attached to (you'll know what I mean when you get your hands on it), throw in a bowl with some taco seasoning &amp; let sit in fridge overnight. Use for anything. Tacos &amp; enchiladas are some of my fave, but really anything people put shredded meat in works with jackfruit (&amp; it looks like shredded meat). My jackfruit BBQ sliders are hugely popular at summer potlucks (it holds up well in a crock pot with sauce). This fruit is a fucking game changer. 

Packets of salted seaweed for snacks. I get them at the Asian market, but Costco carries them too.

[Buffalo Cheddar Potato Nachos](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/crispy-buffalo-cheddar-potato-nachos/)

I made these for the Superbowl this year. Making the potato chips was a pain in the ass, but super worth it. (It'd be easier if you have a mandolin -- I sliced by hand and had to babysit them in the oven to pull out the ones that were crispy sooner because they were thinner.) But you could do it on store bought chips or fries if you want to make it easy.

[Buffalo Twice Baked Potatoes](http://www.simplystacie.net/2014/09/buffalo-twice-baked-potatoes/)

Simple, and also a fun play on twice baked potatoes for a meat-free option because I personally think regular twice baked potatoes are lame without bacon. But these have enough going on I don't miss that. I made this [Celery-Green Apple Salad](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/green-apple-and-celery-salad-with-walnuts-and-mustard-vinaigrette-233139) to go with it.

Some people are big on the buffalo cauliflower. I've never gotten them crispy enough to feel like a real replacement. It just ends up like eating spicy cauliflower. If you're really looking to replace buffalo wings, I recommend getting plain, vegetarian ""chicken"" nuggets and tossing those in wing sauce. (Don't get the premade ""buffalo"" kind because they taste like garbage and are missing the sauce aspect.)

Additionally, anything you put a bunch of butter and hot sauce (and bleu cheese, if that's your thing) in is going to taste like buffalo. I've done buffalo mac &amp; cheese, buffalo deviled eggs, buffalo chick(en)pea salad, etc, though all of those were just kind of made up so I don't have recipes.",1,1
2017-01,1200isplenty,14.0,The buffalo cauliflower is watery and boring. It's not even buffalo sauce. Just cayenne-based hot sauce. Missing the buttery element altogether. Definitely better to make your own with Frank's Buffalo!,1,1

""ranch dip ingredients:

1 C wildwood zesty garlic aioli (or vegan mayonnaise of your choice)

1/8 C non-dairy milk

2 tsp apple cider vinegar

1 tsp onion powder

1/4 tsp sea salt

1/4 tsp ground pepper

1 tbsp dill

1 tbsp parsley

1 tbsp chives

If you use a regular vegan mayonnaise without garlic in it, then you might also want to add 1 tsp of garlic powder.

Finely chop the fresh dill, parsley and chives. Whisk together all the ingredients until smooth.

Alternatively (and this is how I prepare the ranch) you can blend together vegan mayonnaise, non-dairy milk, apple cider vinegar, onion powder, garlic powder, sea salt and ground pepper in a blender. Pour the dip into a jar or serving bowl and stir in the fresh herbs. Refrigerate before serving. """,1,1

2017-10,vegan,1.0,"Two things helped me,

1. Making a slow transition. I started out reducing my meat consumption to only a few times a week, then I stopped cooking meat at home and only eating it when dining out and eventually becoming vegetarian then vegan. By the end of it I didn't really miss th food I used To eat. 

2. Identifying what I loved about certain omni food and how to replicate that in vegan food. I'm figured out I'm bigger on the flavours, crunch and sauces that meat dishes can come with than the meat itself. For example what I loved about buffalo chicken wings was more the buffalo sauce than the chicken. Buffalo cauliflower bites are a great substitute! A burrito bowl with no meat is still delicious to me because I love the Mexican flavours and the fresh salsa and creamy guacamole. 

I don't really miss cheese, I haven't bothered buying vegan substitutes since I haven't felt the need. Soy milk in my coffee and cereal took a little time to adjust to, I started with the sweetened stuff for a couple of weeks to get used to the taste before switching to unsweetened.
